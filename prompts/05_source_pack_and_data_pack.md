# 05 – Source Pack & Data Pack for {{TOPIC}}

We now want a data-backed blog. Build a compact “source pack” and “data pack” we can embed into the article.

## Task

### A. Source Pack

1. **Books**
   - List at least 3 foundational or strongly relevant books to {{TOPIC}}.
   - For each book:
     - Give title, author, publication year.
     - 1–2 sentence summary of why it’s relevant (e.g., feedback frameworks, performance management, leadership for new managers).

2. **Articles / Reports / Blogs / Papers**
   - List at least 4 credible sources:
     - Company blogs, management blogs, HR or organizational research, or peer-reviewed papers.
   - For each source:
     - Title, author/organization, year (if available), and URL.
     - 1–2 sentence summary of the key idea(s) relevant to {{TOPIC}}.

### B. Data Pack

From the sources above (especially reports and research), pull **2–3 key statistics or data points per source** where possible.

For each statistic:

- Provide the direct quote or very close paraphrase.
- Include:
  - The metric/value (e.g., “~30% of employees…”).
  - The context (who, where, what study).
  - The citation (Author, Year) + URL.

If books contain explicit data or summarized findings, include 1–2 of those as well. If not, focus on their conceptual contributions instead of forcing numbers.

## Output Format

1. **Source Pack**
   - “Books” subheading with a short numbered list.
   - “Articles/Reports” subheading with a numbered list.

2. **Data Pack**
   - A list of bullet points or short paragraphs:
     - Each item: `Source (Author, Year) – 1–2 sentences explaining the stat and why it matters`, plus URL.

Do **not** invent numbers. If you can’t find stats for a given source, skip stats for that source rather than fabricating.

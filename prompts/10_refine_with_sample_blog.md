# 10 – Refinement Using a Reference Blog

You now have:
- A near-final draft blog on {{TOPIC}}.
- Style and AI-slop guardrails.
- Optionally, an external reference blog the user likes.

## Inputs

- {{DRAFT_V2}} – your best draft so far.
- {{REFERENCE_BLOG}} – the full text (or large excerpt) of a blog post whose flow and readability the user likes.
- Optional notes from the user on what they liked or disliked.

## Task

1. Analyze {{REFERENCE_BLOG}} to infer:
   - Pacing (how quickly it moves between ideas).
   - Depth versus readability (how it balances detail with clarity).
   - How it handles openings, transitions, and conclusions.
   - Any noticeable strengths (e.g., story-driven examples, strong closing, concrete scripts).

2. Critique your own {{DRAFT_V2}} against that reference:
   - Where is your draft too dense, too vague, or poorly paced?
   - Which sections could benefit from clearer transitions or more concrete examples?
   - Where can you remove redundancy?

3. Produce a **refined version** of {{DRAFT_V2}} that:
   - Keeps the structure, argument, and citations.
   - Improves clarity, pacing, and readability inspired by {{REFERENCE_BLOG}}.
   - Preserves your unique voice and avoids copying phrasing or structure from {{REFERENCE_BLOG}}.

## Constraints

- Do not copy sentences or distinctive wording from {{REFERENCE_BLOG}}.
- Keep all factual claims and citations intact unless you are fixing an error.
- Continue to obey AI-slop guardrails and bullets policy.

## Output

- A single revised markdown article on {{TOPIC}} that incorporates these refinements and is ready for publication.

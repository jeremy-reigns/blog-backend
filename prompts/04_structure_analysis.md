# 04 – Structure, Tone, and Opening Analysis

You now have a set of top articles on {{TOPIC}}.

## Task

Analyze those articles and extract patterns in:

1. **Subtopics & Coverage**
   - What subtopics or sections show up repeatedly?
   - Where do they differ meaningfully?
   - Which areas do they tend to ignore that are important for {{TOPIC}} (especially for a *new* manager with limited team history)?

2. **Structure**
   - How do these articles typically open?
   - How do they transition from context → advice → examples → conclusion?
   - What is the typical length and depth?

3. **Tone and Voice**
   - Are they conversational, formal, HR-driven, or manager-to-manager?
   - How much do they rely on concrete examples versus abstract principles?

4. **Opening Statements**
   - Summarize the most common opening patterns in 2–3 sentences.
   - Identify 2–3 *better* patterns (from the set or inspired by them) that feel more human, specific, and relevant to {{TOPIC}}.

## Output Format

- Short sections with headings:
  - “Common Subtopics”
  - “Typical Structure”
  - “Tone & Voice Patterns”
  - “Opening Patterns: What Works, What Doesn’t”
- For each section, use dense paragraphs (not bullets by default) and highlight concrete patterns and gaps.
- Finish with a short paragraph describing how *our* article structure will improve on these patterns (e.g., more specific to new managers, more data-backed, more scripts, fewer platitudes).

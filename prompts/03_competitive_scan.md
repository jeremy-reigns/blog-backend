# 03 – Competitive Scan: Top Articles on the Topic

You have:
- The main topic {{TOPIC}}.
- A proposed structure of subtopics from the previous step.

Your job now is to scan for strong, existing content on {{TOPIC}} so we understand the landscape.

## Task

1. Find ~10 high-quality, relevant blog posts or articles that address {{TOPIC}} or a very close variant.
   - Prioritize:
     - Engineering / product / leadership blogs from well-known companies.
     - Thoughtful individual blogs with substantial, original analysis.
   - Prefer recent and widely-referenced content where possible.

2. For each article, return:
   - Title
   - Author or organization
   - URL
   - 1–2 sentence summary of its angle or unique focus (e.g., “very tactical and script-heavy”, “framework-oriented”, “HR-policy centric”).

3. At the end, briefly note:
   - What types of perspectives are *overrepresented* (e.g., HR compliance, very generic advice).
   - What perspectives seem *underrepresented* or missing (e.g., new manager with little history, remote teams, engineering-specific examples).

## Output Format

- A numbered list of 10 entries, each with:
  - **Title** – Author/Org – URL  
    Short 1–2 sentence angle summary.
- A closing paragraph with 3–5 sentences about gaps and opportunities you see.

Keep descriptions specific; avoid generic praise like “very insightful” without explaining *why*.

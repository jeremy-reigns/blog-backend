# 07 – Draft v1: Data-Backed Blog on {{TOPIC}}

You now have:
- A structure (subtopics and narrative flow).
- A competitive scan of existing articles.
- A source pack and data pack.
- External validation prompts (optionally used).

Your task is to write the **first full draft** of the blog.

## Requirements

### Structure & Formatting

- Use H1 for the title, H2 for main sections, H3/H4 for subsections as needed.
- Write in full paragraphs as the default.
- Avoid bulleted lists unless:
  - You are listing compact examples, scripts, or checklists.
  - The bullets improve scannability for that particular section.
- When you do use bullets, keep items short (1–2 lines) and do not over-nest.
- End each major section with a smooth transition that points to the next idea.

### Tone & Style

- Neutral, clear, professional; suitable for technical or engineering-oriented readers and managers.
- Direct and honest about trade-offs and uncertainty.
- No stock phrases or AI-slop patterns (see global style guardrails).
- Vary sentence length and structure; prefer active voice and specific verbs.
- Define any necessary jargon briefly at first use.

### Use of Sources & Data

- Use the data pack to support key claims; mention sources naturally in the text (e.g., “A 2020 study by X found that…”).
- Do **not** fabricate sources or statistics.
- If you don’t have a source for a claim, either:
  - Frame it as an observation, experience, or hypothesis, or
  - Omit it.

### Focus for {{TOPIC}}

- Keep the article grounded in the situation described by {{TOPIC}} (e.g., a new manager with limited history writing performance reviews).
- Show empathy for the constraints, not just ideal-world advice.
- Provide practical steps, scripts, and examples a reader can actually use.

## Output

- A fully-formed blog draft in markdown.
- No TL;DR yet (that will come later).
- No separate bibliography – just cite informally in the prose for now.

  "final_post": "# How to Handle Difficult Conversations as an Engineering Manager \u2014 Especially When Performance Management Scares You\n\n_By [Author Name], [Date]_\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nPerformance conversations as a new engineering manager\u2014especially with a team you hardly know\u2014can feel overwhelming. You can navigate them with clarity and credibility by being concrete, transparent, and genuinely human, even when the data or trust is limited.\n\n- Focus your energy on repeated or high-stakes issues, not everyday awkward feedback.\n- Gather recent, direct evidence; skip the hearsay and fuzzy impressions.\n- Structure discussions for clarity: open honestly, cite specifics, ask for context, and plan next steps together.\n- Name your own nerves\u2014acknowledging tension lowers it for both sides.\n- Don\u2019t over-soften, over-document, or punt difficult talks into the future.\n- Success is about shared understanding\u2014not immediate harmony.\n\n---\n\nYou barely know your direct reports, but you\u2019re already facing your first performance issue as an engineering manager. There\u2019s a knot in your stomach as you realize the feedback you\u2019ve collected is patchy, and your understanding of team history is wafer-thin. The playbooks make it sound like process and empathy will fix everything, but the reality is trickier: you\u2019re balancing the risk of upending fragile trust against letting real problems drag on. How do you step into this conversation without making things worse\u2014for them, for the team, or for yourself?\n\n## Why Difficult Conversations Trigger Anxiety in New Engineering Managers\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in your nerves. In a 2023 survey, 43% of managers admitted they feel anxious before giving negative feedback, and more than one in five managers said they delay or avoid these conversations altogether (15Five, 2023, [link](https://www.15five.com/resources/research/state-of-employee-experience-2023)). For new engineering managers, the stress doubles: you haven\u2019t built deep relationships, you lack long-term data, and you may not have the technical context to know \u201chow things have always been done.\u201d When your power as a manager collides with your uncertainty as a newcomer, it\u2019s easy to second-guess every word.\n\nBeyond your own discomfort, there\u2019s also team suspicion\u2014no one likes receiving performance feedback from someone who barely knows them. Mishandled conversations can backfire, souring morale or accelerating attrition. Accept that the discomfort is real\u2014a common struggle, not a flaw. That perspective frees you to tackle the hard work, not just the scripted version.\n\nNext, it\u2019s critical to distinguish which issues truly require a \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d versus normal, everyday course corrections.\n\n## Not Every Feedback Moment Needs the \u201cHard Talk\u201d Treatment\n\nIt\u2019s a mistake to treat every awkward or corrective conversation as a career-level event. A small bug in a pull request or a curt comment in chat needs a lighter touch than a pattern of missed deadlines or eroding trust.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n- Has the issue happened more than once or twice?\n- Is this impacting others or derailing work beyond the individual?\n- Will inaction let the problem fester and grow?\n\nIf so, prepare more deeply\u2014it\u2019s genuinely a high-stakes conversation. If not, resist over-indexing on drama. Many new managers burn out by treating every tough moment like an HR formal. Save your energy\u2014and theirs\u2014for the situations that shape the team\u2019s direction.\n\nThis mindset also helps reduce anxiety by reserving your \u201call-in\u201d attention for times when protecting the team or the long-term culture is actually needed.\n\n## Gathering Evidence When You Don\u2019t Have History\n\nOne of the trickiest challenges for a new manager: you don\u2019t have years of personal observation or context to lean on. Secondhand accounts and half-remembered backstories are risky\u2014you don\u2019t want to inherit old grudges or act on rumor. What\u2019s left is simple but powerful: focus on the recent, observable, and objective.\n\nBefore meeting, try:\n\n- Reviewing the last couple of sprints for patterns in missed commitments, incomplete JIRA tickets, or repeated build failures.\n- Checking PRs for recurring review issues or rework that creates friction downstream.\n- Collecting any peer feedback that references specific incidents\u2014not general opinions.\n\nGut-check your material with a simple test: \u201cCould I walk through these points with another manager and be confident I have my facts straight?\u201d If not, dig further.\n\nResearch supports this approach: managers who ground hard conversations in specific, up-to-date observations dramatically reduce misunderstandings and repeated conflicts (Patterson et al., 2011, _Crucial Conversations_). And if you\u2019re coming in cold, say so. \u201cI recognize I don\u2019t have historical context, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen since joining\u2026\u201d Honesty about your own limitations fosters trust and keeps the conversation from feeling like a trial.\n\nStrong prep also builds your own confidence. Even a modest review of data or artifacts, done with integrity, helps you lead the discussion rather than get bowled over by new information or defensiveness (LeadDev Editorial, 2021, [link](https://leaddev.com/people/framework-challenging-conversations-engineers)).\n\nOnce you have a foundation, move toward the conversation itself: not by script, but through intent and structure.\n\n## Running the Conversation\u2014Practical Structures That Work\n\nRigid scripts rarely hold up in the real world, but a flexible framework is invaluable. One popular model\u2014Radical Candor\u2014urges managers to \u201ccare personally and challenge directly\u201d (Scott, 2017). Here\u2019s a practical flow that respects both intent and flexibility:\n\n1. **Open honestly:**  \n   \u201cI want to check in about something that\u2019s come up in my short time here.\u201d\n\n2. **State what you\u2019ve observed:**  \n   \u201cI noticed that in the last two sprints, you\u2019ve missed key deadlines\u2014like the payment integration PR, which took several rounds of rework.\u201d\n\n3. **Solicit their perspective:**  \n   \u201cCan you share what\u2019s been going on from your end? I know I may be missing context.\u201d\n\n4. **Discuss impact and options:**  \n   \u201cThese misses are starting to affect the team\u2019s overall progress. I\u2019d like to figure out what needs to change\u2014how can I help make that practical?\u201d\n\n5. **Confirm shared understanding and plan:**  \n   \u201cLet\u2019s touch base after the next sprint to see what\u2019s working better, and please keep giving me feedback too.\u201d\n\nThese steps keep you grounded in facts, invite honesty, and focus on outcomes rather than blame or venting. Key: mention openly where your own knowledge is limited. This doesn\u2019t undermine your authority; it builds mutual trust and protects against blind spots.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth naming emotions in the room. Veteran managers report that a simple admission\u2014\u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous too, but I want to make this as helpful as possible\u201d\u2014makes the conversation less adversarial (Julie Zhuo, 2019, [link](https://www.juliezhou.com/writing/giving-difficult-feedback)).\n\nNow, with structure and awareness, it\u2019s time to address the nerves that haunt even the best prep.\n\n## Navigating Your Own Anxiety\u2014Before, During, and After\n\nEven practiced managers admit sweaty palms and tight throats before performance conversations (15Five, 2023). For new managers, that pressure can be paralyzing. Here\u2019s what works:\n\nBeforehand, recite your opening and evidence out loud. This isn\u2019t theater\u2014verbal rehearsal knocks off nerves and prevents opening fumbles. Take just enough notes to stay organized, but avoid scripting every interaction. When the moment arrives, let the conversation breathe. If it gets tense, narrate it gently: \u201cI know this conversation feels awkward. That\u2019s normal, and it means we care about getting it right.\u201d\n\nAfterward, give yourself space to debrief, jot a short log for your own learning (and, yes, for compliance), and move on. Don\u2019t let one rocky talk sour your view of your role or your report\u2014reflection, not rumination, is how you\u2019ll improve this skill over time.\n\nThese habits are not \u201csoft skills\u201d\u2014they\u2019re the foundation for resilience and long-term credibility as a manager.\n\nWith emotions and structure managed, beware the mistakes that trip up even diligent leaders.\n\n## Pitfalls: Where Good Intentions Go Sideways\n\nSome errors cut across experience levels. The top avoidable traps:\n\n- **Over-softening:** If you dilute the message, you risk no improvement. \u201cYou\u2019re doing mostly fine, just\u2026\u201d isn\u2019t feedback\u2014it's confusion.\n- **Defaulting to heavy documentation:** New managers sometimes log everything \u201cjust in case,\u201d making reports feel they\u2019re already under HR\u2019s microscope. Document, but don\u2019t let it replace conversation.\n- **Letting discomfort stall you:** The longer you wait, the harder the conversation becomes, and the more baked-in the problem gets.\n- **Relying on data alone:** Metrics matter, but teams look for context and fairness\u2014numbers can\u2019t explain away surprise blockers or team dynamics.\n\nEven if you trip up, revisiting the conversation and owning your mistakes is almost always repairable. Openness and humility are remembered longer than perfect delivery.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about realistic metrics of success.\n\n## What \u201cGood\u201d Looks Like (And What \u201cSuccess\u201d Isn\u2019t)\n\nA successful difficult conversation is rarely glamorous or cathartic. Often, it\u2019s quiet: you\u2019ve made the issue clear, you have a plan, and neither side is retreating or defensive. Sometimes, the best outcome is agreement to track changes and review soon. Other times, you learn there\u2019s a hidden blocker\u2014a personal issue, a process gap, or something outside your initial view\u2014that only the conversation surfaced.\n\nResearch\u2014and community consensus\u2014shows that regular, direct feedback (not just praise or scripted critique) is closely tied to both team engagement and retention (Scott, 2017; 15Five, 2023). Don\u2019t chase instant agreement or a tension-free room. If you\u2019ve set a direction and established commitment to improvement, that\u2019s a win. Over the long run, the ability to handle messiness head-on is what moves both manager and team forward.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nPerformance management as a green engineering manager can feel like walking a tightrope with no net. Yet by holding yourself to specifics, showing honest vulnerability about what you do and don\u2019t know, and focusing on clarity over comfort, you build resilience and trust with your team. These talks will never be easy\u2014but with preparation and openness, they can become productive, sometimes even transformative, for everyone involved.\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n1. **15Five, \u201cThe State of Employee Experience 2023\u201d (2023):** Quantitative insights on anxiety, feedback quality, and engagement correlations.

# Software Engineering Leads: Handling a Poor Performing Team Member with Limited History

_By [Author Name], [Date]_

**TL;DR:**  
New engineering managers often inherit team members labeled as “underperformers” but with little reliable context. Here’s how to cut through noise, find the root cause, and act fairly—without risking your credibility or team morale.

- Prioritize direct evidence and artifacts, not gossip or rumor.
- Look for patterns of underperformance—not one-off stumbles.
- Find out: Is the issue skill, motivation, or environment?
- Have honest conversations early; don’t wait for formal process.
- Formal PIPs seldom “fix” things—try mentorship or a scoped pivot first.
- Guard your team’s health by weighing both project output and group morale.

You inherit a team in mid-project, and soon subtle flags start appearing: missed deadlines, grumbling about a team member’s pull requests, a few private remarks about “not a team player.” You don’t have months of context, and most information comes secondhand. So how do you decide if someone’s truly underperforming, how to uncover what’s actually wrong, and—most challenging—how to intervene without derailing the team’s momentum or making the wrong call?

## Defining “Poor Performance”—Move Beyond the Obvious

Not all performance issues are created equal. It’s easy to point to late deliverables or buggy code, but real underperformance can look like chronic communication gaps, unreliable handoffs, or simply “slipping past the radar.” 

For new managers, the risk of inheriting team biases is real. Community veterans warn that the person everyone fingers as the underperformer is sometimes wrestling with legacy code, unclear onboarding, or unvoiced team norms. Before acting, pause to separate surface symptoms from underlying patterns—what exactly is broken, and why do you believe it’s a persistent issue?

Getting past the obvious helps you focus on actual improvement instead of treating the wrong problem.

## Spotting Patterns: Temporary Slump or Lasting Problem?

Good engineers have bad weeks. Life happens—personal stress, bottlenecked sprints, or demotivating assignments can impact anyone. A single screw-up doesn’t equal chronic underperformance.

Camille Fournier (2017) recommends anchoring on trends—not one-off incidents. Skim the person’s recent commits and task flow: do you see the same problems cropping up? Is there a repeated need for rework, regular peer pushback, or are “misses” accumulating over releases? Compare their baseline today with any prior work you can access—even if the history is thin.

If you lack firsthand context, keep your working theory open. Patterns will present themselves—or won’t.

From here, shift to how you distinguish fact from fiction.

## Evidence First: Don’t Rely on Gossip

Lacking your own history, prioritize evidence over hearsay. Managers with only “he said, she said” to go on make the worst calls.

Here’s what practitioners recommend:

- Scan the person’s code and pull request history. Are unfinished tasks, lots of last-minute changes, or frequent misunderstandings piling up?
- Do a technical walkthrough with them. “Can you walk me through this recent change?” lets you spot both strengths and gaps.
- Gather structured peer input. Instead of “What do you think about Alex?”, ask, “What’s one workflow Alex could improve?” This narrows the feedback to action, not rumor.

360 reviews and peer feedback often degrade into office politics if not streamlined. A new manager’s limited track record means you need observable evidence—deliverables and design choices—much more than “the team vibe” ([Orosz, 2022](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/low-performing-software-engineer/)).

With some signal in hand, don’t jump to conclusions—move to a diagnosis.

## Getting to Why: Skill, Motivation, or Fit?

Solutions depend on cause. Lara Hogan’s “skill/will/fit” model cuts through guesswork ([Hogan, 2018](https://larahogan.me/blog/low-performers/)):

- **Skill:** Is the challenge technical? An engineer might be drowning because the stack is new or expectations unclear. Orosz (2022) found that role or stack mismatch was a major root for ~40% of flagged cases.
- **Motivation:** Are they demotivated, late, or disengaged? Look for context—burnout, unclear advancement, or life stress.
- **Fit:** Sometimes a technically solid engineer causes team friction or bucks company culture. For new managers, this is the trickiest area since you might inherit a narrative shaped by politics or mismatches, not facts.

Test rather than guess. Assign a defined project, try pairing, or clarify what “good” looks like. See if things bounce back.

Now you’re ready for honest feedback—especially important as the “new boss.”

## Have the Conversation—Sooner, Not Later

Delay makes things worse. Industry data shows 60% of engineering managers wish they had acted faster on underperformance ([Orosz, 2022](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/low-performing-software-engineer/)). A private, honest talk works better than vague nudges or escalation. 

Kim Scott’s “Radical Candor” mantra—challenge directly, care personally—remains a north star ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/the-feedback-mindset/)). When you raise concerns:

> “In the last few sprints, I’ve noticed several tickets getting stuck. Can we look at what’s making those tasks hard to finish?”

Or, when the impact is more visible:
> “Several handoffs have slipped lately, and the team’s pushing hard to catch up. From your vantage point, what’s blocking us?”

Especially as a new manager, be explicit about your limited knowledge:
> “I’m new here and want to check my assumptions. Could we walk through your last sprint together and talk about what’s working and what’s not?”

Agree on one or two concrete next steps. Vague encouragement or “just try harder” undermines trust.

Direct action sets the foundation for any later steps—including escalation, if needed.

## Performance Plans and Escalation: Proceed With Caution

Formal Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) play more of a defensive than a developmental role in most engineering orgs. Their success rate is bleak—only 16% of developers on PIPs rebound long-term ([Jeli, 2022](https://www.jeli.io/blog/the-engineering-managers-guide-to-performance-improvement-plans)). In reality, they’re more about process and legal clarity than rescuing someone’s career.

If a PIP is unavoidable:
- Specify measurable, near-term goals, addressing concrete deliverables.
- Meet more than just at the milestones—frequent check-ins improve fairness.
- Keep feedback tied to observable tasks and outcomes.

But if you reach for a PIP, realize the meaningful turnaround usually happens well before paperwork. The most sustainable improvements come from targeted coaching, paired work, or shifting someone to a role or project where their strengths align. Each failed PIP isn’t just the employee’s loss—it’s rough on you and your credibility, too.

Next, let’s flag the missteps new leads hit most.

## Rookie Traps: What to Avoid as a New Manager

New managers without history fall into two extremes: waiting so long for more “data” that momentum stalls, or acting too quickly on rumor and group mood.

Watching patterns:

- Allowing open secrets—where everyone knows about ongoing problems but nothing’s addressed—weakens trust in your leadership.
- Acting rashly on secondhand complaints risks damaging the reputation of someone who may just need context or a fresh challenge.

Before you act, check yourself:

- Can you point to actual missed deliverables or documentation?
- Are expectations for performance clear now and were they before?
- Does the pattern repeat, or was it a single incident?

If uncertain, grab a reality check from a peer manager. In the end, don’t delegate responsibility; you own the call.

Consistent, fair intervention is visible to the team and shapes future culture.

## What Good Looks Like—Accountability Meets Empathy

When managed well, performance intervention creates transparency, not anxiety. Respected leads keep their bar high and their process transparent: they dig into blockers, ask for direct feedback, and share expectations early.

Real-world stories show this isn’t theory. One engineering manager shared: “After pairing our struggling colleague with a peer mentor, and clearly resetting goals week by week, that person rebounded and now leads our most complex feature area” ([Hogan, 2018](https://larahogan.me/blog/low-performers/)). Even if an exit eventually happens, being honest and specific protects the morale of those who remain.

A combination of clarity, curiosity, and consistency transforms these moments from crises into a chance to strengthen—or even reshape—your team.

## Takeaway: Step Up Early, Step Up Fairly

If you’re the new lead handed an “underperformer,” don’t reach for the nearest process. Gather real evidence, open a real conversation, and look for the core cause before pushing toward correction or escalation. The hardest moves—early direct talk, honest next steps—are rarely comfortable. But handled well, they’ll define your leadership and make your team stronger in the long run.

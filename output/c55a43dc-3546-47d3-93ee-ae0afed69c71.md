# How to Write a Great Performance Review When You’re a New Manager (Without Much Team History)

*By [Your Name], [Date]*

**TL;DR:**  
Even when you’re new and lack deep history with your team, you can deliver fair, credible, and actionable performance reviews. How? Gather evidence from multiple sources, structure your comments thoughtfully, and be candid about your vantage point.

- Be transparent about your perspective and its limits.
- Collect input beyond your own observations—use self, peer, and project evidence (First Round Review, 2021).
- Make feedback concrete, using models like Situation-Behavior-Impact.
- Balance praise, growth areas, and actionable suggestions for next steps.
- Avoid repeating past reviews or boilerplate assessments.
- Treat reviews as a springboard for ongoing trust and conversation.

It’s your first review cycle as a manager, but you haven’t had time to deeply observe everyone on your team. Maybe you’re still learning faces, or you inherited a group mid-project with patchy documentation. Yet expectations are real: you must deliver detailed, fair, and actionable feedback—even when you have more questions than answers about past performance. How can you write a review that’s credible, useful, and builds trust when your vantage point is so limited?

## What Makes a Performance Review Actually Useful?

Too many reviews are merely procedural, offering little insight beyond, “Good job this year!” In fact, over half of all employees report their most recent review was “generic” or didn’t capture what they actually contributed (Coyle-Shapiro et al., 2022, [HBR](https://hbr.org/2022/10/how-to-write-performance-reviews-that-actually-help-employees)). A great review answers a more fundamental question: “Was I seen, was my work understood, and do I know where to go from here?”

For new managers, this feels especially challenging. But that’s precisely why a thoughtful review—clear, specific, and focused on development—can make a lasting impression. Even when you lack history, your process for building credibility is what sets you apart.

Let’s dig into why limited history is such a hurdle, and what you can do about it.

## Facing Reality: Limited History, Bias, and Blind Spots

Being honest about what you’ve seen—and what you haven’t—prevents both overconfidence and disengagement. In a First Round Review survey, less than 35% of newly promoted managers felt even “somewhat confident” in their first round of reviews; most leaned on peer and self-feedback to understand their team’s work (First Round Review, 2021, [First Round](https://review.firstround.com/how-to-write-year-end-reviews-with-almost-no-data)).

This introduces obvious risk. You might overweight the most visible people or repeat praise (or critique) from a previous manager without context. On the flip side, if you hedge and go generic, people sense your hesitation—and over half find this kind of review actively demotivating (Coyle-Shapiro et al., 2022, [HBR](https://hbr.org/2022/10/how-to-write-performance-reviews-that-actually-help-employees)). The best path is to call out these limits directly and make your process for filling them part of the conversation.

Next, you’ll need to assemble a more reliable picture—without pretending you know things you don’t.

## Gathering Reliable Input When You’re New

You don’t have to guess or improvise alone; you have options for creating a fuller view of each team member’s work. Avoid making sweeping conclusions from a handful of meetings or hoping legacy notes tell the whole story. Instead, seek out several concrete sources.

**Build your evidence base:**

- **Self-assessments:** Ask team members to share recent wins, learning moments, and honest stumbling blocks. Push for specifics about projects and outcomes.
- **Peer feedback:** Encourage peers to share snapshots (“What’s one way this person helped recently? Where could they stretch next?”). Keep prompts consistent for fairness.
- **Project artifacts and outcomes:** Consult code reviews, demo notes, incident reports, and project retrospectives for documented impact.
- **Short predecessor handover:** If possible, ask the prior manager for a couple of recent, concrete examples—not general reputation.

Set expectations with your team by being upfront: “Because I’m new, I’m gathering feedback from you and your collaborators, in addition to what I’ve observed. My goal is to make every review as fair and actionable as possible.” According to Kim Scott’s Radical Candor approach, this blend of transparency and specific evidence helps managers build trust up to three times faster (Scott, 2020, [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/performance-reviews-done-right/)).

With your research in hand, you’re ready to turn data points into a review that’s readable, fair, and genuinely helpful.

## Giving Structure to Your Review

Data alone isn’t enough; you must show you’ve made sense of it. Avoid the cut-and-paste trap—your job is to weave together patterns, not just list whatever people said.

A straightforward, repeatable structure works even when you don’t know someone deeply:

1. **Snapshot summary:** Distill major themes in a sentence or two—what’s the arc of their year or past six months?
2. **Key strengths (with evidence):** Highlight two or three direct examples—what did they demonstrably do well? (“Your Q3 code reviews flagged critical bugs; peers look to you for architectural advice.”)
3. **Growth area:** Name one actionable opportunity for development. Attribute feedback as needed: “Peers suggested that sharing the reasoning behind your technical decisions would help juniors learn more quickly.”
4. **Forward focus:** Suggest next steps (“As we onboard new hires, try pairing up to share your onboarding tips and boost your mentorship skills.”)

This method mitigates two risks: overemphasizing single incidents or drowning people in a jumble of unrelated notes. It also mirrors how top companies have improved review fairness and accuracy by anchoring every statement in recent, concrete evidence (Cappelli & Tavis, 2016, [HBR](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution)).

Once your review has a spine, the next challenge is getting specific—without overstepping what you know.

## Being Specific and Honest (Even If You Haven’t Seen Everything)

As a new manager, you’ll be tempted to soften your statements or generalize. Instead, use a feedback technique developed by organizational psychologists: the **Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model** (Center for Creative Leadership).

- **Situation:** Set the context (“During our Q2 release…”)
- **Behavior:** State what the person actually did (“…you led incident triage and brought clarity to every status meeting…”)
- **Impact:** Share the result (“…which helped us restore service 30% faster and kept the team calm under stress.”)

When your observation is secondhand, attribute it: “Peers consistently mentioned your focus on unblocking teammates during the migration project.” Or, “Your own reflection highlighted X, which I see echoed in peer feedback.”

People trust reviews grounded in concrete, recent stories—regardless of whether you saw them first-hand (Scott, 2020, [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/performance-reviews-done-right/); Stone & Heen, 2014). Stating, “Based on my current view and peer input…” is more credible than trying to mask your vantage point.

## Pitfalls to Avoid: Repeats, Overreliance, and Timidity

Even well-meaning new managers make two classic mistakes: blindly echoing what others have said, and shying away from constructive feedback altogether. It’s easy to give weight to a story just because it’s memorable or widely repeated, but this can carry over misperceptions or interpersonal baggage. Always look for themes and corroboration.

Perhaps surprisingly, being vague or “nice” rarely wins you respect. Over half of employees say reviews that feel recycled or insubstantial are not merely unhelpful—they’re actually demotivating or feel inaccurate (Coyle-Shapiro et al., 2022, [HBR](https://hbr.org/2022/10/how-to-write-performance-reviews-that-actually-help-employees)). It’s better to name your uncertainty but still offer a perspective:  
  “Based on the feedback and my own observations, you’ve excelled in X. One area that came up for development was Y—does that match your experience?”

Naming the limits of your assessment, while still providing clear suggestions, signals respect and opens the door for productive follow-up.

## A Review Is Just the Start

Your first review cycle is more than a box to check; it’s a signal of what kind of manager you’ll be. Use it to start candid, ongoing dialogue. Make clear which parts of your feedback are based on direct observation and which rely on team input. Invite discussion and review how your process can evolve next cycle.

Organizations that embed frequent, high-quality feedback—rooted in specific examples and ongoing conversations—see measurable gains in engagement and growth (Cappelli & Tavis, 2016). With each review, you build not just individual performance, but the trust and openness that make high-performing teams possible.

Approached with humility, discipline, and candor, even a first round of reviews can be both fair and genuinely valued—even if you’re still learning the names.

A Practical Guide for Getting More from Your Meetings\n\n*By [Author Name], [Date]*\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nNavigating 1:1 meetings as a new team member or with a new manager often feels awkward. Use these meetings intentionally\u2014focusing on context, feedback, and growth\u2014to accelerate trust and turn a recurring block on your calendar into a real lever for your development.\n\n- Most 1:1s end up as bland status updates\u2014don\u2019t let yours (Rogelberg, 2022).\n- Prioritize honest feedback, context, and development, not just task alignment (Scott, 2017; Zhuo, 2019).\n- Show up with 1\u20132 focused questions grounded in your current needs.\n- Early, authentic moves\u2014like requesting candid feedback\u2014build long-term trust (Fellow, 2023).\n- Watch out for common pitfalls: vague agendas, only airing complaints, or waiting for review season for feedback.\n- Adapt your approach as the relationship evolves; check in explicitly to keep meetings useful for both sides.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re fifteen minutes into your first real 1:1 with your new manager. The small talk fizzles, and the conversation feels oddly weightless\u2014you don\u2019t have big blockers to report, you barely know each other, and the polite back-and-forth leaves both of you skirting what actually matters. How do you move beyond filler and surface talk, especially when you don\u2019t yet have a track record together? If you\u2019ve ever left a one-on-one wondering, \u201cWhat should I actually be asking?\u201d\u2014this is for you.\n\n---\n\n## What Are 1:1s Actually For?\n\nToo often, 1:1s slip into routine status reporting, missing the unique chance to tackle the things that don\u2019t fit anywhere else. The real purpose goes far deeper: these meetings are a structured touchpoint for honest feedback, gaining context, and developing both the work and the working relationship. Kim Scott frames the 1:1 as \u201cthe single most important thing you can do to build trust\u201d on a team (Scott, 2017). Julie Zhuo goes further, describing it as the \u201csingle most powerful relationship-building tool\u201d a manager can use (Zhuo, 2019).\n\nDespite this potential, most employees report never getting that value. Only 42% see regular 1:1s at all, and even then, too many meetings stick to surface-level updates (Rogelberg, 2022). As a newcomer or someone seeking stronger footing, knowing you can safely bring bigger questions\u2014to clarify direction, seek feedback, or flag confusion\u2014gives you an immediate advantage.\n\nUnderstanding the purpose is the first step; acting on it is the next.\n\n---\n\n## Assessing Your Relationship and What You Want\n\nA productive 1:1 starts outside the meeting. Take a moment before the session to check in with yourself: \u201cWhat would really help me right now?\u201d Maybe you\u2019re unclear about priorities, still learning the team\u2019s culture, or looking for active feedback. Maybe you just need validation that you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nDefine your goal and shape one or two clear questions around it. For example:\n- If you need feedback: \u201cWould you mind sharing how my onboarding is going so far? Anything I should change?\u201d\n- If you want context: \u201cCan you explain why we switched to this project approach last week?\u201d\n- If you seek direction: \u201cWhat should I focus on to contribute most in my first months?\u201d\n\nComing prepared\u2014instead of waiting for your manager to run the meeting\u2014signals intent and keeps the session focused. Over time, this habit shapes the entire manager-report rhythm.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what you can safely address\u2014and how to frame it.\n\n---\n\n## What\u2019s Appropriate to Ask? Demystifying the Boundaries\n\nLots of people underplay the scope of what\u2019s valid to discuss. It\u2019s more than okay\u2014it\u2019s expected\u2014to go beyond project lists. Most managers prefer to hear about emerging confusions, growth ambitions, or external pressures sooner, not later.\n\nGood 1:1s might touch on:\n\n- **Project context:** \u201cCan you help me understand our decision on X?\u201d  \n- **Feedback:** \u201cIs there anything about my last pull request you\u2019d like me to do differently?\u201d\n- **Growth:** \u201cWhat could I be learning right now that makes a difference a few months out?\u201d\n- **Team or cultural norms:** \u201cWhat\u2019s an unwritten rule here that took you by surprise?\u201d  \n- **Manager\u2019s perspective:** \u201cWhat\u2019s the hardest part of your week right now?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re worried, preface your question: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this, but\u2026\u201d Most managers will be grateful you opened the door. Extensive research and case studies show that bringing up ambiguity or challenge early helps head off bigger team health issues (Scott, 2017; First Round Review, 2017).\n\nYour needs will shift as you settle in\u2014use these meetings to steer that change, not just react to it.\n\n---\n\n## High-Value Questions to Bring to Your 1:1\n\nEver sit down and draw a mental blank? You\u2019re not alone. Here\u2019s a set of focused questions matched to common early-stage situations. Treat them as inspiration, not a checklist.\n\n**How to get oriented:**  \n- \u201cWhat tripped you up when you joined this team?\u201d  \n- \u201cIs there a hidden process I should know about before I learn the hard way?\u201d\n\n**Building a feedback loop:**  \n- \u201cHow did that handoff go from your perspective?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhere do you see me adding the most (or least) value?\u201d\n\n**Clarifying priorities:**  \n- \u201cGiven my limited background here, what\u2019s worth over-indexing on this month?\u201d  \n- \u201cAnything on my list that doesn\u2019t actually matter right now?\u201d\n\n**Planning for growth:**  \n- \u201cIf I want to develop towards a tech lead, what\u2019s a small first step?\u201d  \n- \u201cIs there a cross-team project you think I\u2019d learn from?\u201d\n\n**Understanding your manager\u2019s world:**  \n- \u201cHow do you like to get feedback?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhat would make your life easier from me this sprint?\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t use these all at once. As you get a feel for the working dynamic, mix them in\u2014one or two each session is enough. Even small, thoughtful questions set a tone of curiosity and mutual investment.\n\nWith these scripts at the ready, the real challenge becomes building the trust to use them openly.\n\n---\n\n## How to Build Trust and Signal Openness\u2014Even Early On\n\nEarly trust doesn\u2019t require dramatic gestures\u2014it\u2019s a product of steady, low-key moves: asking questions, listening closely, following up, and showing that you\u2019ll actually use the feedback you get. Scott\u2019s \u201cRadical Candor\u201d model boils trust down to being consistently curious and direct, especially when the relationship is new (Scott, 2017).\n\nThe data backs this up: nearly 80% of employees report that regular 1:1s matter for their growth and relationship with their manager, but only when the conversation gets real (Fellow, 2023). Start small:\n- Offer some context for your needs: \u201cStill learning the ropes\u2014please flag anything I\u2019m not seeing yet.\u201d\n- Set expectations: \u201cI appreciate honesty, even if it\u2019s early or rough around the edges.\u201d\n- Name tensions before they fester: \u201cIt feels awkward to ask about some things, but I\u2019d rather clear it up than let it linger.\u201d\n\nThese moves not only build trust\u2014they set the tone for a future where deeper topics aren\u2019t off-limits. Most managers appreciate signals that you\u2019re engaged and resilient to feedback, making it easier for them to be candid right back.\n\nAs the mutual comfort level grows, you can nudge for even bolder topics and experiments.\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls That Undercut 1:1s\u2014and How to Avoid Them\n\nIt\u2019s easy to misfire on 1:1s\u2014and the most common missteps can be avoided with a little forethought.\n\n- **Letting 1:1s become status-only meetings:**  \n  Send a written update before the meeting; reserve the 1:1 for tough questions, feedback, or context (Rogelberg, 2022).\n\n- **Raising issues without a solution or ask:**  \n  It\u2019s fine to flag problems, but add, \u201cWhat would you suggest?\u201d or \u201cAny advice on my next step?\u201d\n\n- **Saving all real feedback for performance reviews:**  \n  Use 1:1s to test early concerns or observations before they become major problems (First Round Review, 2017).\n\n- **Letting meetings drift or go stale:**  \n  Every few sessions, check in: \u201cShould we keep this format? Anything new we should cover?\u201d\n\nTop companies and experienced managers warn that when 1:1s are neglected or become predictable, wider team performance and retention soon suffer (First Round Review, 2017).\n\nBy catching these missteps early\u2014and correcting your own course\u2014you keep your meetings valuable.\n\n---\n\n## Iterating on Your 1:1 Practice Over Time\n\nGreat 1:1s aren\u2019t a one-off achievement\u2014they\u2019re something you build as the relationship evolves. Every so often, pause to reflect: \u201cIs this still working for me?\u201d Explicitly invite your manager to do the same.\n\nManagers who stick to regular, high-quality 1:1s see triple the team engagement rates, but it\u2019s the *substance* of the meeting that makes the difference (Fellow, 2023). Sometimes this means making space for a technical deep dive, sometimes for coaching, or even a casual gut-check on priorities.\n\nDon\u2019t shy away from \u201cmeta\u201d topics:  \n- \u201cAre these discussions helping you as much as they help me?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat haven\u2019t we tried in these meetings that might make them more useful?\u201d\n\nOwning the quality of your 1:1s\u2014just like owning your technical or project work\u2014is a skill that pays off over the long run, for both you and your manager.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nYou don\u2019t need a script or a decades-deep history to make 1:1s valuable. Arrive prepared with a question or two, use your early meetings to set trust on a solid foundation, and stay willing to change things up as your needs shift. In a world where most employees miss out on this leverage, simply using your 1:1s with intention sets you apart\u2014boosting your learning, impact, and your manager\u2019s confidence in you.\n\n---\n\n*Sources Cited:*\n\n1.

# What Should You Ask Your Manager in 1:1s? A Practical Guide for Getting More from Your Meetings

**TL;DR:**  
Navigating 1:1 meetings as a new team member or with a new manager often feels awkward. Use these meetings intentionally—focusing on context, feedback, and growth—to accelerate trust and turn a recurring block on your calendar into a real lever for your development.

- Most 1:1s end up as bland status updates—don’t let yours (Rogelberg, 2022).
- Prioritize honest feedback, context, and development, not just task alignment (Scott, 2017; Zhuo, 2019).
- Show up with 1–2 focused questions grounded in your current needs.
- Early, authentic moves—like requesting candid feedback—build long-term trust (Fellow, 2023).
- Watch out for common pitfalls: vague agendas, only airing complaints, or waiting for review season for feedback.
- Adapt your approach as the relationship evolves; check in explicitly to keep meetings useful for both sides.

You’re fifteen minutes into your first real 1:1 with your new manager. The small talk fizzles, and the conversation feels oddly weightless—you don’t have big blockers to report, you barely know each other, and the polite back-and-forth leaves both of you skirting what actually matters. How do you move beyond filler and surface talk, especially when you don’t yet have a track record together? If you’ve ever left a one-on-one wondering, “What should I actually be asking?”—this is for you.

## What Are 1:1s Actually For?

Too often, 1:1s slip into routine status reporting, missing the unique chance to tackle the things that don’t fit anywhere else. The real purpose goes far deeper: these meetings are a structured touchpoint for honest feedback, gaining context, and developing both the work and the working relationship. Kim Scott frames the 1:1 as “the single most important thing you can do to build trust” on a team (Scott, 2017). Julie Zhuo goes further, describing it as the “single most powerful relationship-building tool” a manager can use (Zhuo, 2019).

Despite this potential, most employees report never getting that value. Only 42% see regular 1:1s at all, and even then, too many meetings stick to surface-level updates (Rogelberg, 2022). As a newcomer or someone seeking stronger footing, knowing you can safely bring bigger questions—to clarify direction, seek feedback, or flag confusion—gives you an immediate advantage.

Understanding the purpose is the first step; acting on it is the next.

## Assessing Your Relationship and What You Want

A productive 1:1 starts outside the meeting. Take a moment before the session to check in with yourself: “What would really help me right now?” Maybe you’re unclear about priorities, still learning the team’s culture, or looking for active feedback. Maybe you just need validation that you’re on the right track.

Define your goal and shape one or two clear questions around it. For example:
- If you need feedback: “Would you mind sharing how my onboarding is going so far? Anything I should change?”
- If you want context: “Can you explain why we switched to this project approach last week?”
- If you seek direction: “What should I focus on to contribute most in my first months?”

Coming prepared—instead of waiting for your manager to run the meeting—signals intent and keeps the session focused. Over time, this habit shapes the entire manager-report rhythm.

Let’s explore what you can safely address—and how to frame it.

## What’s Appropriate to Ask? Demystifying the Boundaries

Lots of people underplay the scope of what’s valid to discuss. It’s more than okay—it’s expected—to go beyond project lists. Most managers prefer to hear about emerging confusions, growth ambitions, or external pressures sooner, not later.

Good 1:1s might touch on:

- **Project context:** “Can you help me understand our decision on X?”  
- **Feedback:** “Is there anything about my last pull request you’d like me to do differently?”
- **Growth:** “What could I be learning right now that makes a difference a few months out?”
- **Team or cultural norms:** “What’s an unwritten rule here that took you by surprise?”  
- **Manager’s perspective:** “What’s the hardest part of your week right now?”

If you’re worried, preface your question: “I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but…” Most managers will be grateful you opened the door. Extensive research and case studies show that bringing up ambiguity or challenge early helps head off bigger team health issues (Scott, 2017; First Round Review, 2017).

Your needs will shift as you settle in—use these meetings to steer that change, not just react to it.

## High-Value Questions to Bring to Your 1:1

Ever sit down and draw a mental blank? You’re not alone. Here’s a set of focused questions matched to common early-stage situations. Treat them as inspiration, not a checklist.

**How to get oriented:**  
- “What tripped you up when you joined this team?”  
- “Is there a hidden process I should know about before I learn the hard way?”

**Building a feedback loop:**  
- “How did that handoff go from your perspective?”  
- “Where do you see me adding the most (or least) value?”

**Clarifying priorities:**  
- “Given my limited background here, what’s worth over-indexing on this month?”  
- “Anything on my list that doesn’t actually matter right now?”

**Planning for growth:**  
- “If I want to develop towards a tech lead, what’s a small first step?”  
- “Is there a cross-team project you think I’d learn from?”

**Understanding your manager’s world:**  
- “How do you like to get feedback?”  
- “What would make your life easier from me this sprint?”

You won’t use these all at once. As you get a feel for the working dynamic, mix them in—one or two each session is enough. Even small, thoughtful questions set a tone of curiosity and mutual investment.

With these scripts at the ready, the real challenge becomes building the trust to use them openly.

## How to Build Trust and Signal Openness—Even Early On

Early trust doesn’t require dramatic gestures—it’s a product of steady, low-key moves: asking questions, listening closely, following up, and showing that you’ll actually use the feedback you get. Scott’s “Radical Candor” model boils trust down to being consistently curious and direct, especially when the relationship is new (Scott, 2017).

The data backs this up: nearly 80% of employees report that regular 1:1s matter for their growth and relationship with their manager, but only when the conversation gets real (Fellow, 2023). Start small:
- Offer some context for your needs: “Still learning the ropes—please flag anything I’m not seeing yet.”
- Set expectations: “I appreciate honesty, even if it’s early or rough around the edges.”
- Name tensions before they fester: “It feels awkward to ask about some things, but I’d rather clear it up than let it linger.”

These moves not only build trust—they set the tone for a future where deeper topics aren’t off-limits. Most managers appreciate signals that you’re engaged and resilient to feedback, making it easier for them to be candid right back.

As the mutual comfort level grows, you can nudge for even bolder topics and experiments.

## Common Pitfalls That Undercut 1:1s—and How to Avoid Them

It’s easy to misfire on 1:1s—and the most common missteps can be avoided with a little forethought.

- **Letting 1:1s become status-only meetings:**  
  Send a written update before the meeting; reserve the 1:1 for tough questions, feedback, or context (Rogelberg, 2022).

- **Raising issues without a solution or ask:**  
  It’s fine to flag problems, but add, “What would you suggest?” or “Any advice on my next step?”

- **Saving all real feedback for performance reviews:**  
  Use 1:1s to test early concerns or observations before they become major problems (First Round Review, 2017).

- **Letting meetings drift or go stale:**  
  Every few sessions, check in: “Should we keep this format? Anything new we should cover?”

Top companies and experienced managers warn that when 1:1s are neglected or become predictable, wider team performance and retention soon suffer (First Round Review, 2017).

By catching these missteps early—and correcting your own course—you keep your meetings valuable.

## Iterating on Your 1:1 Practice Over Time

Great 1:1s aren’t a one-off achievement—they’re something you build as the relationship evolves. Every so often, pause to reflect: “Is this still working for me?” Explicitly invite your manager to do the same.

Managers who stick to regular, high-quality 1:1s see triple the team engagement rates, but it’s the *substance* of the meeting that makes the difference (Fellow, 2023). Sometimes this means making space for a technical deep dive, sometimes for coaching, or even a casual gut-check on priorities.

Don’t shy away from “meta” topics:  
- “Are these discussions helping you as much as they help me?”
- “What haven’t we tried in these meetings that might make them more useful?”

Owning the quality of your 1:1s—just like owning your technical or project work—is a skill that pays off over the long run, for both you and your manager.

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need a script or a decades-deep history to make 1:1s valuable. Arrive prepared with a question or two, use your early meetings to set trust on a solid foundation, and stay willing to change things up as your needs shift. In a world where most employees miss out on this leverage, simply using your 1:1s with intention sets you apart—boosting your learning, impact, and your manager’s confidence in you.

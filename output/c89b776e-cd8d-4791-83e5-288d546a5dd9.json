  "final_post": "# What Should You Really Discuss in 1 on 1s with Your Engineering Manager?\n\n*By [Author Name], [Date]*\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nFor new engineering managers and their teams, 1:1s can feel vague\u2014or even tense\u2014especially when trust is just starting to form. Treat these meetings as space to explore, not just report.\n\n- Prioritize building trust, not rushing through a status checklist.\n- Let team members steer the agenda: ask what truly matters to them.\n- Bring real examples\u2014blockers, recognition, or process pain.\n- Use a shared, evolving agenda and revisit tough topics over time.\n- Expect awkwardness; even \u201cbad\u201d 1:1s provide clues.\n- Adjust as you go; valuable feedback comes with patience.\n\n---\n\nPicture this: You\u2019re a few weeks into your first engineering manager role. There's no shared history yet, the routines feel new, and as one-on-ones start populating your calendar, you wonder: what actually makes these meetings useful? The silences, hesitations, and \u201cwhat do you want to discuss?\u201d moments are normal. This is the starting point\u2014the real work of 1:1s begins right here.\n\n---\n\n## Why Do 1 on 1s Exist in Engineering, Really?\n\nOne-on-ones aren\u2019t just another check-in. Unlike team meetings that zero in on delivery, 1:1s create protected space for what\u2019s usually unsaid: the small tensions, doubts, aspirations, and practical roadblocks that don\u2019t surface elsewhere.\n\nA 2020 Gallup study found that employees who have regular 1:1s are three times more likely to be engaged at work. Yet, only about 1 in 5 strongly agree that their performance is managed in a motivating way (Gallup, 2020: [source](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/354278/value-employee-one-one-meetings.aspx)). The difference often comes down to whether managers use the time for genuine connection rather than just procedural checklists.\n\nFor new managers, your first job isn\u2019t to fix everything or extract perfect feedback. Use these sessions to build basic rapport, let people set the agenda, and get curious about how work really gets done. If this feels uncomfortable, you\u2019re probably doing it right. Think of the first few meetings as auditioning formats and candidly letting your team know you\u2019re still learning.\n\nWhen you make the space work for your team\u2014not just your process\u2014you open the door for honest feedback and real growth.\n\n---\n\n## Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety: Why They Dictate the Agenda\n\nEvery 1:1 is shaped by the simple fact that, as a manager, you hold more formal power. This means that no matter how approachable you seem, reports will weigh their words\u2014and what feels \u201csafe\u201d to say\u2014until trust catches up with intent.\n\nKim Scott\u2019s Radical Candor model frames the manager\u2019s challenge: \u201ccare personally, challenge directly\u201d ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)). But theory only goes so far if your team is still figuring out your expectations, values, or hot buttons.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Project Aristotle famously found that psychological safety is the strongest predictor of high-performing teams ([Google, 2016](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/)). 1:1s are the place to build that safety, not just presume it.\n\nIn early sessions, make it clear the agenda is theirs just as much as yours. Try, \u201cWhat would make this hour useful to you?\u201d and actually listen. If you\u2019re new and don\u2019t know the team\u2019s history, own it. Share that you are learning and invite their observations\u2014especially about what\u2019s not working.\n\nSignals matter more than scripts: follow through on small asks, respect confidentiality, and keep showing up even when the conversation stalls. The more reliable the meeting, the more likely your team will eventually open up.\n\n---\n\n## Topics That Actually Matter for Engineers\n\nAdvice about one-on-ones often stays abstract. But for engineering teams, the gold lies in tackling real, gritty details of technical and team life\u2014not just repeating \u201cstatus, feedback, career\u201d by rote.\n\nBy your third or fourth 1:1, start bringing in questions or examples that go deeper:\n\n- **Technical Blockers:**  \n  \u201cWhat\u2019s slowing you down lately? Is it tooling, unclear requirements, or something more subtle?\u201d\n\n- **Team Process Friction:**  \n  \u201cAre standups, code reviews, or sprints actually helping\u2014or do they get in the way?\u201d\n\n- **Quality of Collaboration:**  \n  \u201cWhere are handoffs clunky or communication breaking down?\u201d\n\n- **Recognition & Impact:**  \n  \u201cWhat have you shipped or fixed that quietly made a difference? Has anyone noticed?\u201d\n\n- **Growth Opportunities:**  \n  \u201cIs there a new area or project you\u2019d like to try, or something you want to learn?\u201d\n\n- **Technical Debt & Neglected Work:**  \n  \u201cWhat keeps getting pushed down the backlog, but continues to hurt us?\u201d\n\nA 2024 GetLighthouse survey found that over 60% of ICs say their 1:1s rarely touch on broader frustrations or ambitions; most default to urgent project details ([GetLighthouse, 2024](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting/)). Being deliberate about these deeper topics is how you break that cycle.\n\nMaking the conversation concrete signals that this is time for digging into real blockers\u2014not just ticking boxes. Over time, this sets a tone that your 1:1s are about improvement, not just accountability.\n\nReady to set a broader agenda? Let\u2019s look at how to make growth, recognition, and career real\u2014without waiting for review season.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Growth, Recognition, and Career Path in 1 on 1s\n\nCareer discussions can feel forced\u2014especially if you and your report haven\u2019t worked together for long. Still, if you don\u2019t bring them up, you risk sending the message that growth is \u201cfor later,\u201d or worse, not your concern.\n\nJulie Zhuo notes that the best career-development isn\u2019t a one-time deep dive, but the sum of smaller, recurring check-ins ([Zhuo, 2019](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/)). If you\u2019re new, say so, and make it explicit you want their help understanding which feedback, skills, or opportunities matter.\n\nMix in career and recognition check-ins every few 1:1s by asking:\n\n- \u201cWhat kind of feedback helps you grow? Are you getting enough?\u201d\n- \u201cIs there a project or skill you wish you\u2019d had a shot at?\u201d\n- \u201cWhere do you want more visibility for your work?\u201d\n\nEngineers: don\u2019t assume your manager \u201cjust knows.\u201d If you want to lead an initiative or be considered for promo, share your interests and ask how the process works.\n\nBuild a small backlog of career and recognition questions to revisit over time. Repetition is not laziness\u2014it\u2019s how clarity builds, especially across awkward or slow-moving starts.\n\nNext, let\u2019s tackle the most avoided territory: tough conversations and honest feedback.\n\n---\n\n## Navigating Tough Conversations: Feedback, Conflict, and Disappointment\n\nThe most valuable 1:1s are often the most uncomfortable. Naming a friction, questioning a decision, or surfacing disappointment can feel risky\u2014especially in new manager/report pairs. But silence costs more: issues fester and trust erodes under the surface.\n\nKim Scott suggests managers \u201csolicit criticism before they give it,\u201d making curiosity the guiding principle in hard topics ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)). For example:\n\n- \u201cCan you help me understand what happened during that tricky code review?\u201d\n- \u201cHave there been any choices lately that don\u2019t sit right with you?\u201d\n\nEngineers might try:  \n\u201cI want to be more open about things that frustrate me, but don\u2019t know your style yet. What\u2019s the best way for us to tackle disagreements or vent safely?\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s research shows psychological safety is the precondition for these talks\u2014they aren\u2019t possible if either side worries about retaliation, embarrassment, or being ignored ([Google, 2016](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/)).\n\nDon\u2019t expect instant candor. Progress can mean agreeing to revisit a topic or simply admitting, \u201cThis is difficult.\u201d The key is opening the window, not forcing everything out at once.\n\nBut even the best intentions need effective tactics to avoid stalemates or wasted time.\n\n---\n\n## Tactics for Productive, Low-Stress Engineering 1 on 1s\n\nStructure helps\u2014particularly when the relationship is new. A little rhythm, a little shared control, and a focus on small follow-throughs can turn awkward time into progress.\n\nBorrow and adapt these approaches:\n\n- **Shared, Editable Agenda:**  \n  Use a simple doc to gather talking points ahead of time. Both sides can add or skip topics.\n- **Rotate Deeper Dives:**  \n  Occasionally pause status updates and dig into onboarding, codebase friction, or a retrospective on a just-finished project.\n- **Timebox Sensitive Issues:**  \n  \u201cLet\u2019s test the waters for a few minutes and see if we want to keep going.\u201d\n- **End with Clear Follow-ups:**  \n  Summarize one or two actions\u2014big or small\u2014to chase down before next time.\n\nSurveys find that fewer than 30% of 1:1s consistently touch on career or technical blockers; the vast majority get stuck in task triage ([GetLighthouse, 2024](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting/)). Setting expectations up front, and explicitly reminding your partner \u201cit\u2019s okay to bring up the tough or fuzzy stuff,\u201d nudges the meeting forward.\n\nEarly meetings may feel awkward or redundant\u2014this is predictable, especially with little shared context. Consistency and reliability build goodwill; don\u2019t let a slow start convince you these meetings don\u2019t work.\n\nLet\u2019s close by recognizing the warning signs and course corrections for 1:1s that just aren\u2019t landing.\n\n---\n\n## Warning Signs and Anti-Patterns: When 1 on 1s Quietly Fail\n\nYou\u2019ll see trouble quickly if a 1:1 falls into routine with no reflection: recurring cancellations, short or one-sided dialogue, or simply a sense that nothing ever changes. Will Larson notes that actionable feedback rarely shows up until several sessions in, especially with a new manager ([Larson, 2019](https://elegant-puzzle.com/)). Don\u2019t overreact to slow starts\u2014but do pay attention to shifts.\n\nWatch for:\n\n- Status-only meetings with no feedback or friction explored.\n- Dominance\u2014one person talks, the other tunes out.\n- Action items ignored; problems never revisited.\n- Avoidance, where tough topics become \u201clater\u201d and \u201clater\u201d never comes.\n\nIf you spot these, pause and check in:  \n\u201cOur 1:1s feel a bit repetitive. Anything you\u2019d want to try differently, or topics we\u2019ve been dodging?\u201d\n\nEven a basic reset helps. Treat each iteration as an experiment; the real risk comes from silent disengagement, not brave attempts that fall flat.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: Make 1:1s Count, Even When New\n\nEngineering 1:1s aren\u2019t therapy or status rituals\u2014they\u2019re a protected place for candor and unfinished business. For new managers stepping into unfamiliar teams, perfect meetings are unlikely, and slow progress is normal.\n\nWhat matters most: show up, acknowledge what you don\u2019t know, and use each session to invest in trust and understanding. The best results come not from mastery, but from small, steady steps\u2014imperfect but genuine. Weeks of awkwardness now create months (or years) of better work ahead.\n\n---\n\n**Citations**\n\n- Gallup, [The Value of Employee One-on-One Meetings](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/354278/value-employee-one-one-meetings.aspx), 2020.\n- Kim Scott, [Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity](https://www.radicalcandor.com/), 2017.\n- Google Re:Work, [Project Aristotle Summary](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/), 2016.\n- Julie Zhuo, [The Making of a Manager](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/), 2019.\n- Will Larson, [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://elegant-puzzle.com/), 2019 and [How Engineers Can Get the Most from 1:1s](https://lethain.com/engineer-one-on-ones/), 2017.\n- GetLighthouse, [The Art of the One-on-One Meeting](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting/), 2024.\n- Lara Hogan, [How to Make the Most of Your 1:1s with Your Manager](https://larahogan.me/blog/one-on-ones/), 2017.\n\n"

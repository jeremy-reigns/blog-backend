But with a reset in approach, these meetings can become powerful drivers of technical and organizational leverage.\n\n- Target shared strategic impact, not just short-term progress.\n- Use structured prompts and rotating topics to highlight friction, alignment, and mentorship.\n- Watch for common anti-patterns like static agendas or update-only meetings.\n- Involve staff engineers in shaping the agenda and topics.\n- Address drift directly; experiment with format and ownership.\n- Assess success by evidence of influence, not completed tickets.\n\n---\n\nImagine you\u2019re leading your first 1:1 with a seasoned staff engineer\u2014a technical leader who\u2019s shaped systems, negotiated with stakeholders, and probably outpaces your understanding of the codebase. You\u2019re new to the team, short on shared history, and every instinct urges you to play it safe with a checklist of project updates. But in that moment, you sense what\u2019s really at stake: settling for the obvious risks wasting their potential\u2014and eroding your credibility. How do you turn these meetings into engines for shared technical impact, when you haven\u2019t yet built trust or context?\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Staff Engineer 1:1s Different?\n\nStaff engineers aren\u2019t just feature builders. Their primary role is to boost the effectiveness of those around them, shape technical strategy, and bridge organizational gaps\u2014often in subtle or ambiguous ways (Larson, 2021: [Staff Engineer 1:1s](https://lethain.com/staff-engineer-1-1s/)). Most of their value comes not from producing code but from multiplying the performance of others and influencing critical decisions.\n\nMany managers, especially those new to the staff-plus level, default to safe territory in 1:1s\u2014project status, ticket reviews, or surface-level updates. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that 36% of staff engineers report their meetings with managers \u201crarely or never\u201d address cross-team or strategic issues (LeadDev & Progression, 2022: [State of Engineering Management Report](https://leaddev.com/report-2022-state-engineering-management)). \n\nIf these broader topics never surface, you\u2014and your staff engineer\u2014are likely missing the very impact you\u2019re both accountable for. Recognizing that this is a different conversation sets you up to use 1:1s for real leverage instead of routine oversight.\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns\n\nIt\u2019s easy for staff 1:1s to get stuck. Often, new managers focus on what\u2019s most visible\u2014recent deliverables\u2014avoiding ambiguity out of caution. But staff engineers expect more, and they can sense when you\u2019re not meeting them at their level. Charity Majors put it simply: \u201cIf your 1:1s feel awkward or pointless, your staff engineer often feels the same\u2014it\u2019s a cue you\u2019re missing their biggest challenges or ambitions\u201d (Majors, 2019: [Great 1:1s for Senior ICs](https://charity.wtf/2019/05/31/great-1-1s-for-senior-ics/)).\n\nTypical warning signs are:\n\n- Every meeting is a status check.\n- The conversation never moves beyond team boundaries or immediate goals.\n- The agenda feels repetitive or goes untouched for weeks.\n\nLarson (2021) notes these patterns often mask low trust or a lack of psychological safety. The routine feels safe, but also signals disengagement or uncertainty\u2014especially if you default to surveillance rather than partnership.\n\nSpotting these signs early is critical. Once you see them, you have a chance to redirect the conversation toward higher-value ground.\n\n---\n\n## Aligning on Mission: What Shared Impact Really Means\n\nBefore you can have leveraged 1:1s, you need a clear, shared definition of \u201cimpact.\u201d At the staff level, impact usually falls into three categories (Kua, 2022: [The One-on-One Meeting: Staff Engineers](https://patkua.com/blog/the-one-on-one-meeting-staff-engineers/)):\n\n- **Technical strategy:** Driving decisions that affect large swathes of the codebase or multiple teams.\n- **Organizational friction:** Spotting and breaking down blockers between groups, not just within the team.\n- **Mentorship and influence:** Enabling others to do more, not just delivering through personal output.\n\nWhy does this distinction matter for managers with little context? Because research shows a gap between managers\u2019 and staff engineers\u2019 perceptions: 65% of managers think their 1:1s deliver strong developmental value, but only 45% of staff ICs agree (LeadDev & Progression, 2022). Surfacing the real levers of impact with your staff engineers is not just inclusive\u2014it\u2019s clarifying for you both, and helps close this gap.\n\nClarity on impact transforms vague check-ins into progress on what matters. Let\u2019s look at how you can build that into your regular 1:1s.\n\n---\n\n## Frameworks to Structure High-Value 1:1s\n\nThe best staff 1:1s use structure\u2014without being formulaic. Will Larson (2021) observes that the most effective meetings spend less than 20% of their time rehashing projects or updates. Most of the energy goes elsewhere: tackling obstacles, scanning for misalignments, and connecting isolated efforts across the org.\n\nHow to get there, even with limited context? Try these approaches:\n\n**Shared Agenda-Setting:**  \nEncourage your staff engineer to add pressing topics. This can be as simple as emailing a short list ahead of time, or co-creating a living doc. The point is to treat the 1:1 as a strategic session, not a check-up.\n\n**Rotating Themes:**  \nDeliberately focus on a different area every few weeks. For example:\n\n- \u201cWhere is our architecture under real stress lately?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there gaps in our collaboration with other teams or products?\u201d\n- \u201cWho on the team seems poised for more influence?\u201d\n\n**Structured Obstacle Clearing:**  \nSet aside a few minutes each meeting to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s one organizational obstacle getting in your way right now?\u201d Over time, this creates a safe pattern for surfacing the hard stuff.\n\nThese frameworks let you show up as a partner even if you lack years of shared team context. They build credibility because they\u2019re focused on systemic outcomes that matter at the staff level.\n\nThe next step is operationalizing this with scripts and sample agendas, so you\u2019re never left guessing about what to ask.\n\n---\n\n## Sample Agendas & Conversation Starters\n\nIf you\u2019re new or unsure, pre-prepared prompts can lower the barrier to deeper discussion and keep the meeting out of the \u201cstatus trap.\u201d Here\u2019s a simple sample agenda, inspired by practitioners and data:\n\n**Sample Agenda:**\n- Wins and failures: \u201cWhat took a turn for the better or worse since our last chat?\u201d\n- Organizational friction: \u201cHave any practices, policies, or cross-team dependencies been getting in the way?\u201d\n- Big technical questions: \u201cAre there design or product choices you\u2019re feeling unsure about?\u201d\n- Mentoring and influence: \u201cWho\u2019s ready for new responsibility? Who do we need to back more?\u201d\n- Check-in on commitments: \u201cDid we each follow up on what we set out last time?\u201d\n\n**Starter Questions:**\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s something risky or high-leverage you\u2019d like to pursue if time/resources weren\u2019t a constraint?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there recurring blockers that we\u2019re underestimating?\u201d\n- \u201cWho are the unsung heroes on the teams around you?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat would you change about how our technical direction is set?\u201d\n\nLara Hogan\u2019s research highlights that when managers focus 1:1s on organizational obstacles and development, staff engineers are ~30% more likely to proactively mention blockers or risks (Hogan, 2018: [Better 1:1s with Engineers](https://larahogan.me/blog/better-one-on-ones-with-engineers/)).\n\nUsing these scripts consistently turns theory into a habit\u2014even if you\u2019re still getting up to speed.\n\n---\n\n## Diagnosing Derailed 1:1s: Warning Signs and Realignment Moves\n\nNo matter how you start, 1:1s can lose momentum. Stagnation sometimes creeps in gradually: you notice topics repeat, or the energy drains from the conversation. Watch for these cues:\n\n- Status updates dominate, with no new insights or follow-up.\n- Either party seems distracted or disengaged.\n- There\u2019s a lack of practical action items, or meetings end without direction.\n\nIf you sense drift, vocalize it. Say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure these meetings are helping us move forward. What would make these more worthwhile for you?\u201d Directness, as advocated in *Radical Candor* (Scott, 2017: [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)), gives both sides permission to reset. You might try skipping status for a meeting, or hand off the agenda entirely to your staff engineer for a fresh start.\n\nPeriodic resets signal openness and partnership, not weakness. Over time, this honesty becomes a foundation for trust.\n\n---\n\n## What Success Looks Like: Measuring Staff 1:1 Impact\n\nYou know a staff 1:1 is working when the conversation scales beyond the immediate team and produces evidence of influence. You\u2019ll notice new blockers are identified early, technical direction is clarified, or the staff engineer\u2019s reach is plainly growing. Teams with high-quality 1:1s often see up to 25% lower attrition rates and faster identification of systemic challenges (Scott, 2017; LeadDev & Progression, 2022).\n\nAsk these questions over time:\n\n- Are organizational or cross-team issues being discussed and resolved?\n- Can you directly connect insights from 1:1s to visible changes in architecture, process, or resourcing?\n- Does your staff engineer mention these meetings as a catalyst for strategy or mentoring others?\n\nProgress accumulates\u2014even if you\u2019re still new. The goal is not perfection but steady improvement and clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Closing: From Routine to Leverage\n\nFor managers new to staff 1:1s, it\u2019s easy to settle for checklists or project reviews, especially when you lack history or deep technical context. But with targeted questions, shared structure, and a willingness to experiment, you can move from transactional meetings to conversations that genuinely shape your team\u2019s trajectory.\n\nBring clarity about the purpose of your meetings. Don\u2019t be afraid to acknowledge uncertainty or ask staff engineers to co-design your approach. Over time, these moves transform a calendar slot into a reliable engine for strategic influence, mentorship, and sustained organizational progress."

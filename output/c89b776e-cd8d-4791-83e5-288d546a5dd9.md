**TL;DR:**  
For new engineering managers and their teams, 1:1s can feel vague—or even tense—especially when trust is just starting to form. Treat these meetings as space to explore, not just report.

- Prioritize building trust, not rushing through a status checklist.
- Let team members steer the agenda: ask what truly matters to them.
- Bring real examples—blockers, recognition, or process pain.
- Use a shared, evolving agenda and revisit tough topics over time.
- Expect awkwardness; even “bad” 1:1s provide clues.
- Adjust as you go; valuable feedback comes with patience.

Picture this: You’re a few weeks into your first engineering manager role. There's no shared history yet, the routines feel new, and as one-on-ones start populating your calendar, you wonder: what actually makes these meetings useful? The silences, hesitations, and “what do you want to discuss?” moments are normal. This is the starting point—the real work of 1:1s begins right here.

## Why Do 1 on 1s Exist in Engineering, Really?

One-on-ones aren’t just another check-in. Unlike team meetings that zero in on delivery, 1:1s create protected space for what’s usually unsaid: the small tensions, doubts, aspirations, and practical roadblocks that don’t surface elsewhere.

A 2020 Gallup study found that employees who have regular 1:1s are three times more likely to be engaged at work. Yet, only about 1 in 5 strongly agree that their performance is managed in a motivating way (Gallup, 2020: [source](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/354278/value-employee-one-one-meetings.aspx)). The difference often comes down to whether managers use the time for genuine connection rather than just procedural checklists.

For new managers, your first job isn’t to fix everything or extract perfect feedback. Use these sessions to build basic rapport, let people set the agenda, and get curious about how work really gets done. If this feels uncomfortable, you’re probably doing it right. Think of the first few meetings as auditioning formats and candidly letting your team know you’re still learning.

When you make the space work for your team—not just your process—you open the door for honest feedback and real growth.

## Power Dynamics and Psychological Safety: Why They Dictate the Agenda

Every 1:1 is shaped by the simple fact that, as a manager, you hold more formal power. This means that no matter how approachable you seem, reports will weigh their words—and what feels “safe” to say—until trust catches up with intent.

Kim Scott’s Radical Candor model frames the manager’s challenge: “care personally, challenge directly” ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)). But theory only goes so far if your team is still figuring out your expectations, values, or hot buttons.

Google’s Project Aristotle famously found that psychological safety is the strongest predictor of high-performing teams ([Google, 2016](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/)). 1:1s are the place to build that safety, not just presume it.

In early sessions, make it clear the agenda is theirs just as much as yours. Try, “What would make this hour useful to you?” and actually listen. If you’re new and don’t know the team’s history, own it. Share that you are learning and invite their observations—especially about what’s not working.

Signals matter more than scripts: follow through on small asks, respect confidentiality, and keep showing up even when the conversation stalls. The more reliable the meeting, the more likely your team will eventually open up.

## Topics That Actually Matter for Engineers

Advice about one-on-ones often stays abstract. But for engineering teams, the gold lies in tackling real, gritty details of technical and team life—not just repeating “status, feedback, career” by rote.

By your third or fourth 1:1, start bringing in questions or examples that go deeper:

- **Technical Blockers:**  
  “What’s slowing you down lately? Is it tooling, unclear requirements, or something more subtle?”

- **Team Process Friction:**  
  “Are standups, code reviews, or sprints actually helping—or do they get in the way?”

- **Quality of Collaboration:**  
  “Where are handoffs clunky or communication breaking down?”

- **Recognition & Impact:**  
  “What have you shipped or fixed that quietly made a difference? Has anyone noticed?”

- **Growth Opportunities:**  
  “Is there a new area or project you’d like to try, or something you want to learn?”

- **Technical Debt & Neglected Work:**  
  “What keeps getting pushed down the backlog, but continues to hurt us?”

A 2024 GetLighthouse survey found that over 60% of ICs say their 1:1s rarely touch on broader frustrations or ambitions; most default to urgent project details ([GetLighthouse, 2024](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting/)). Being deliberate about these deeper topics is how you break that cycle.

Making the conversation concrete signals that this is time for digging into real blockers—not just ticking boxes. Over time, this sets a tone that your 1:1s are about improvement, not just accountability.

Ready to set a broader agenda? Let’s look at how to make growth, recognition, and career real—without waiting for review season.

## Addressing Growth, Recognition, and Career Path in 1 on 1s

Career discussions can feel forced—especially if you and your report haven’t worked together for long. Still, if you don’t bring them up, you risk sending the message that growth is “for later,” or worse, not your concern.

Julie Zhuo notes that the best career-development isn’t a one-time deep dive, but the sum of smaller, recurring check-ins ([Zhuo, 2019](https://www.juliezhuo.com/book/)). If you’re new, say so, and make it explicit you want their help understanding which feedback, skills, or opportunities matter.

Mix in career and recognition check-ins every few 1:1s by asking:

- “What kind of feedback helps you grow? Are you getting enough?”
- “Is there a project or skill you wish you’d had a shot at?”
- “Where do you want more visibility for your work?”

Engineers: don’t assume your manager “just knows.” If you want to lead an initiative or be considered for promo, share your interests and ask how the process works.

Build a small backlog of career and recognition questions to revisit over time. Repetition is not laziness—it’s how clarity builds, especially across awkward or slow-moving starts.

Next, let’s tackle the most avoided territory: tough conversations and honest feedback.

## Navigating Tough Conversations: Feedback, Conflict, and Disappointment

The most valuable 1:1s are often the most uncomfortable. Naming a friction, questioning a decision, or surfacing disappointment can feel risky—especially in new manager/report pairs. But silence costs more: issues fester and trust erodes under the surface.

Kim Scott suggests managers “solicit criticism before they give it,” making curiosity the guiding principle in hard topics ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)). For example:

- “Can you help me understand what happened during that tricky code review?”
- “Have there been any choices lately that don’t sit right with you?”

Engineers might try:  
“I want to be more open about things that frustrate me, but don’t know your style yet. What’s the best way for us to tackle disagreements or vent safely?”

Google’s research shows psychological safety is the precondition for these talks—they aren’t possible if either side worries about retaliation, embarrassment, or being ignored ([Google, 2016](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/)).

Don’t expect instant candor. Progress can mean agreeing to revisit a topic or simply admitting, “This is difficult.” The key is opening the window, not forcing everything out at once.

But even the best intentions need effective tactics to avoid stalemates or wasted time.

## Tactics for Productive, Low-Stress Engineering 1 on 1s

Structure helps—particularly when the relationship is new. A little rhythm, a little shared control, and a focus on small follow-throughs can turn awkward time into progress.

Borrow and adapt these approaches:

- **Shared, Editable Agenda:**  
  Use a simple doc to gather talking points ahead of time. Both sides can add or skip topics.
- **Rotate Deeper Dives:**  
  Occasionally pause status updates and dig into onboarding, codebase friction, or a retrospective on a just-finished project.
- **Timebox Sensitive Issues:**  
  “Let’s test the waters for a few minutes and see if we want to keep going.”
- **End with Clear Follow-ups:**  
  Summarize one or two actions—big or small—to chase down before next time.

Surveys find that fewer than 30% of 1:1s consistently touch on career or technical blockers; the vast majority get stuck in task triage ([GetLighthouse, 2024](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meeting/)). Setting expectations up front, and explicitly reminding your partner “it’s okay to bring up the tough or fuzzy stuff,” nudges the meeting forward.

Early meetings may feel awkward or redundant—this is predictable, especially with little shared context. Consistency and reliability build goodwill; don’t let a slow start convince you these meetings don’t work.

Let’s close by recognizing the warning signs and course corrections for 1:1s that just aren’t landing.

## Warning Signs and Anti-Patterns: When 1 on 1s Quietly Fail

You’ll see trouble quickly if a 1:1 falls into routine with no reflection: recurring cancellations, short or one-sided dialogue, or simply a sense that nothing ever changes. Will Larson notes that actionable feedback rarely shows up until several sessions in, especially with a new manager ([Larson, 2019](https://elegant-puzzle.com/)). Don’t overreact to slow starts—but do pay attention to shifts.

Watch for:

- Status-only meetings with no feedback or friction explored.
- Dominance—one person talks, the other tunes out.
- Action items ignored; problems never revisited.
- Avoidance, where tough topics become “later” and “later” never comes.

If you spot these, pause and check in:  
“Our 1:1s feel a bit repetitive. Anything you’d want to try differently, or topics we’ve been dodging?”

Even a basic reset helps. Treat each iteration as an experiment; the real risk comes from silent disengagement, not brave attempts that fall flat.

## Conclusion: Make 1:1s Count, Even When New

Engineering 1:1s aren’t therapy or status rituals—they’re a protected place for candor and unfinished business. For new managers stepping into unfamiliar teams, perfect meetings are unlikely, and slow progress is normal.

What matters most: show up, acknowledge what you don’t know, and use each session to invest in trust and understanding. The best results come not from mastery, but from small, steady steps—imperfect but genuine. Weeks of awkwardness now create months (or years) of better work ahead.

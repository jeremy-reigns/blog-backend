# How to Structure 1:1s With Staff Engineers: Moving Beyond Updates to Shared Impact

*By [Your Name]*

## TL;DR

Many staff engineer 1:1s devolve into status updates—especially if you’re a new manager with limited team history. But with a reset in approach, these meetings can become powerful drivers of technical and organizational leverage.

- Target shared strategic impact, not just short-term progress.
- Use structured prompts and rotating topics to highlight friction, alignment, and mentorship.
- Watch for common anti-patterns like static agendas or update-only meetings.
- Involve staff engineers in shaping the agenda and topics.
- Address drift directly; experiment with format and ownership.
- Assess success by evidence of influence, not completed tickets.

Imagine you’re leading your first 1:1 with a seasoned staff engineer—a technical leader who’s shaped systems, negotiated with stakeholders, and probably outpaces your understanding of the codebase. You’re new to the team, short on shared history, and every instinct urges you to play it safe with a checklist of project updates. But in that moment, you sense what’s really at stake: settling for the obvious risks wasting their potential—and eroding your credibility. How do you turn these meetings into engines for shared technical impact, when you haven’t yet built trust or context?

## What Makes Staff Engineer 1:1s Different?

Staff engineers aren’t just feature builders. Their primary role is to boost the effectiveness of those around them, shape technical strategy, and bridge organizational gaps—often in subtle or ambiguous ways (Larson, 2021: [Staff Engineer 1:1s](https://lethain.com/staff-engineer-1-1s/)). Most of their value comes not from producing code but from multiplying the performance of others and influencing critical decisions.

Many managers, especially those new to the staff-plus level, default to safe territory in 1:1s—project status, ticket reviews, or surface-level updates. It’s no surprise, then, that 36% of staff engineers report their meetings with managers “rarely or never” address cross-team or strategic issues (LeadDev & Progression, 2022: [State of Engineering Management Report](https://leaddev.com/report-2022-state-engineering-management)). 

If these broader topics never surface, you—and your staff engineer—are likely missing the very impact you’re both accountable for. Recognizing that this is a different conversation sets you up to use 1:1s for real leverage instead of routine oversight.

## Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

It’s easy for staff 1:1s to get stuck. Often, new managers focus on what’s most visible—recent deliverables—avoiding ambiguity out of caution. But staff engineers expect more, and they can sense when you’re not meeting them at their level. Charity Majors put it simply: “If your 1:1s feel awkward or pointless, your staff engineer often feels the same—it’s a cue you’re missing their biggest challenges or ambitions” (Majors, 2019: [Great 1:1s for Senior ICs](https://charity.wtf/2019/05/31/great-1-1s-for-senior-ics/)).

Typical warning signs are:

- Every meeting is a status check.
- The conversation never moves beyond team boundaries or immediate goals.
- The agenda feels repetitive or goes untouched for weeks.

Larson (2021) notes these patterns often mask low trust or a lack of psychological safety. The routine feels safe, but also signals disengagement or uncertainty—especially if you default to surveillance rather than partnership.

Spotting these signs early is critical. Once you see them, you have a chance to redirect the conversation toward higher-value ground.

## Aligning on Mission: What Shared Impact Really Means

Before you can have leveraged 1:1s, you need a clear, shared definition of “impact.” At the staff level, impact usually falls into three categories (Kua, 2022: [The One-on-One Meeting: Staff Engineers](https://patkua.com/blog/the-one-on-one-meeting-staff-engineers/)):

- **Technical strategy:** Driving decisions that affect large swathes of the codebase or multiple teams.
- **Organizational friction:** Spotting and breaking down blockers between groups, not just within the team.
- **Mentorship and influence:** Enabling others to do more, not just delivering through personal output.

Why does this distinction matter for managers with little context? Because research shows a gap between managers’ and staff engineers’ perceptions: 65% of managers think their 1:1s deliver strong developmental value, but only 45% of staff ICs agree (LeadDev & Progression, 2022). Surfacing the real levers of impact with your staff engineers is not just inclusive—it’s clarifying for you both, and helps close this gap.

Clarity on impact transforms vague check-ins into progress on what matters. Let’s look at how you can build that into your regular 1:1s.

## Frameworks to Structure High-Value 1:1s

The best staff 1:1s use structure—without being formulaic. Will Larson (2021) observes that the most effective meetings spend less than 20% of their time rehashing projects or updates. Most of the energy goes elsewhere: tackling obstacles, scanning for misalignments, and connecting isolated efforts across the org.

How to get there, even with limited context? Try these approaches:

**Shared Agenda-Setting:**  
Encourage your staff engineer to add pressing topics. This can be as simple as emailing a short list ahead of time, or co-creating a living doc. The point is to treat the 1:1 as a strategic session, not a check-up.

**Rotating Themes:**  
Deliberately focus on a different area every few weeks. For example:

- “Where is our architecture under real stress lately?”
- “Are there gaps in our collaboration with other teams or products?”
- “Who on the team seems poised for more influence?”

**Structured Obstacle Clearing:**  
Set aside a few minutes each meeting to ask, “What’s one organizational obstacle getting in your way right now?” Over time, this creates a safe pattern for surfacing the hard stuff.

These frameworks let you show up as a partner even if you lack years of shared team context. They build credibility because they’re focused on systemic outcomes that matter at the staff level.

The next step is operationalizing this with scripts and sample agendas, so you’re never left guessing about what to ask.

## Sample Agendas & Conversation Starters

If you’re new or unsure, pre-prepared prompts can lower the barrier to deeper discussion and keep the meeting out of the “status trap.” Here’s a simple sample agenda, inspired by practitioners and data:

**Sample Agenda:**
- Wins and failures: “What took a turn for the better or worse since our last chat?”
- Organizational friction: “Have any practices, policies, or cross-team dependencies been getting in the way?”
- Big technical questions: “Are there design or product choices you’re feeling unsure about?”
- Mentoring and influence: “Who’s ready for new responsibility? Who do we need to back more?”
- Check-in on commitments: “Did we each follow up on what we set out last time?”

**Starter Questions:**
- “What’s something risky or high-leverage you’d like to pursue if time/resources weren’t a constraint?”
- “Are there recurring blockers that we’re underestimating?”
- “Who are the unsung heroes on the teams around you?”
- “What would you change about how our technical direction is set?”

Lara Hogan’s research highlights that when managers focus 1:1s on organizational obstacles and development, staff engineers are ~30% more likely to proactively mention blockers or risks (Hogan, 2018: [Better 1:1s with Engineers](https://larahogan.me/blog/better-one-on-ones-with-engineers/)).

Using these scripts consistently turns theory into a habit—even if you’re still getting up to speed.

## Diagnosing Derailed 1:1s: Warning Signs and Realignment Moves

No matter how you start, 1:1s can lose momentum. Stagnation sometimes creeps in gradually: you notice topics repeat, or the energy drains from the conversation. Watch for these cues:

- Status updates dominate, with no new insights or follow-up.
- Either party seems distracted or disengaged.
- There’s a lack of practical action items, or meetings end without direction.

If you sense drift, vocalize it. Say, “I’m not sure these meetings are helping us move forward. What would make these more worthwhile for you?” Directness, as advocated in *Radical Candor* (Scott, 2017: [Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/)), gives both sides permission to reset. You might try skipping status for a meeting, or hand off the agenda entirely to your staff engineer for a fresh start.

Periodic resets signal openness and partnership, not weakness. Over time, this honesty becomes a foundation for trust.

## What Success Looks Like: Measuring Staff 1:1 Impact

You know a staff 1:1 is working when the conversation scales beyond the immediate team and produces evidence of influence. You’ll notice new blockers are identified early, technical direction is clarified, or the staff engineer’s reach is plainly growing. Teams with high-quality 1:1s often see up to 25% lower attrition rates and faster identification of systemic challenges (Scott, 2017; LeadDev & Progression, 2022).

Ask these questions over time:

- Are organizational or cross-team issues being discussed and resolved?
- Can you directly connect insights from 1:1s to visible changes in architecture, process, or resourcing?
- Does your staff engineer mention these meetings as a catalyst for strategy or mentoring others?

Progress accumulates—even if you’re still new. The goal is not perfection but steady improvement and clarity.

## Closing: From Routine to Leverage

For managers new to staff 1:1s, it’s easy to settle for checklists or project reviews, especially when you lack history or deep technical context. But with targeted questions, shared structure, and a willingness to experiment, you can move from transactional meetings to conversations that genuinely shape your team’s trajectory.

Bring clarity about the purpose of your meetings. Don’t be afraid to acknowledge uncertainty or ask staff engineers to co-design your approach. Over time, these moves transform a calendar slot into a reliable engine for strategic influence, mentorship, and sustained organizational progress.

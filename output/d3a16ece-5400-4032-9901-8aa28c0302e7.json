  "final_post": "# Software Engineering Leads: Handling a Poor Performing Team Member with Limited History\n\n_By [Author Name], [Date]_\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nNew engineering managers often inherit team members labeled as \u201cunderperformers\u201d but with little reliable context. Here\u2019s how to cut through noise, find the root cause, and act fairly\u2014without risking your credibility or team morale.\n\n- Prioritize direct evidence and artifacts, not gossip or rumor.\n- Look for patterns of underperformance\u2014not one-off stumbles.\n- Find out: Is the issue skill, motivation, or environment?\n- Have honest conversations early; don\u2019t wait for formal process.\n- Formal PIPs seldom \u201cfix\u201d things\u2014try mentorship or a scoped pivot first.\n- Guard your team\u2019s health by weighing both project output and group morale.\n\n---\n\nYou inherit a team in mid-project, and soon subtle flags start appearing: missed deadlines, grumbling about a team member\u2019s pull requests, a few private remarks about \u201cnot a team player.\u201d You don\u2019t have months of context, and most information comes secondhand. So how do you decide if someone\u2019s truly underperforming, how to uncover what\u2019s actually wrong, and\u2014most challenging\u2014how to intervene without derailing the team\u2019s momentum or making the wrong call?\n\n## Defining \u201cPoor Performance\u201d\u2014Move Beyond the Obvious\n\nNot all performance issues are created equal. It\u2019s easy to point to late deliverables or buggy code, but real underperformance can look like chronic communication gaps, unreliable handoffs, or simply \u201cslipping past the radar.\u201d \n\nFor new managers, the risk of inheriting team biases is real. Community veterans warn that the person everyone fingers as the underperformer is sometimes wrestling with legacy code, unclear onboarding, or unvoiced team norms. Before acting, pause to separate surface symptoms from underlying patterns\u2014what exactly is broken, and why do you believe it\u2019s a persistent issue?\n\nGetting past the obvious helps you focus on actual improvement instead of treating the wrong problem.\n\n## Spotting Patterns: Temporary Slump or Lasting Problem?\n\nGood engineers have bad weeks. Life happens\u2014personal stress, bottlenecked sprints, or demotivating assignments can impact anyone. A single screw-up doesn\u2019t equal chronic underperformance.\n\nCamille Fournier (2017) recommends anchoring on trends\u2014not one-off incidents. Skim the person\u2019s recent commits and task flow: do you see the same problems cropping up? Is there a repeated need for rework, regular peer pushback, or are \u201cmisses\u201d accumulating over releases? Compare their baseline today with any prior work you can access\u2014even if the history is thin.\n\nIf you lack firsthand context, keep your working theory open. Patterns will present themselves\u2014or won\u2019t.\n\nFrom here, shift to how you distinguish fact from fiction.\n\n## Evidence First: Don\u2019t Rely on Gossip\n\nLacking your own history, prioritize evidence over hearsay. Managers with only \u201che said, she said\u201d to go on make the worst calls.\n\nHere\u2019s what practitioners recommend:\n\n- Scan the person\u2019s code and pull request history. Are unfinished tasks, lots of last-minute changes, or frequent misunderstandings piling up?\n- Do a technical walkthrough with them. \u201cCan you walk me through this recent change?\u201d lets you spot both strengths and gaps.\n- Gather structured peer input. Instead of \u201cWhat do you think about Alex?\u201d, ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s one workflow Alex could improve?\u201d This narrows the feedback to action, not rumor.\n\n360 reviews and peer feedback often degrade into office politics if not streamlined. A new manager\u2019s limited track record means you need observable evidence\u2014deliverables and design choices\u2014much more than \u201cthe team vibe\u201d ([Orosz, 2022](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/low-performing-software-engineer/)).\n\nWith some signal in hand, don\u2019t jump to conclusions\u2014move to a diagnosis.\n\n## Getting to Why: Skill, Motivation, or Fit?\n\nSolutions depend on cause. Lara Hogan\u2019s \u201cskill/will/fit\u201d model cuts through guesswork ([Hogan, 2018](https://larahogan.me/blog/low-performers/)):\n\n- **Skill:** Is the challenge technical? An engineer might be drowning because the stack is new or expectations unclear. Orosz (2022) found that role or stack mismatch was a major root for ~40% of flagged cases.\n- **Motivation:** Are they demotivated, late, or disengaged? Look for context\u2014burnout, unclear advancement, or life stress.\n- **Fit:** Sometimes a technically solid engineer causes team friction or bucks company culture. For new managers, this is the trickiest area since you might inherit a narrative shaped by politics or mismatches, not facts.\n\nTest rather than guess. Assign a defined project, try pairing, or clarify what \u201cgood\u201d looks like. See if things bounce back.\n\nNow you\u2019re ready for honest feedback\u2014especially important as the \u201cnew boss.\u201d\n\n## Have the Conversation\u2014Sooner, Not Later\n\nDelay makes things worse. Industry data shows 60% of engineering managers wish they had acted faster on underperformance ([Orosz, 2022](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/low-performing-software-engineer/)). A private, honest talk works better than vague nudges or escalation. \n\nKim Scott\u2019s \u201cRadical Candor\u201d mantra\u2014challenge directly, care personally\u2014remains a north star ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/the-feedback-mindset/)). When you raise concerns:\n\n> \u201cIn the last few sprints, I\u2019ve noticed several tickets getting stuck. Can we look at what\u2019s making those tasks hard to finish?\u201d\n\nOr, when the impact is more visible:\n> \u201cSeveral handoffs have slipped lately, and the team\u2019s pushing hard to catch up. From your vantage point, what\u2019s blocking us?\u201d\n\nEspecially as a new manager, be explicit about your limited knowledge:\n> \u201cI\u2019m new here and want to check my assumptions. Could we walk through your last sprint together and talk about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not?\u201d\n\nAgree on one or two concrete next steps. Vague encouragement or \u201cjust try harder\u201d undermines trust.\n\nDirect action sets the foundation for any later steps\u2014including escalation, if needed.\n\n## Performance Plans and Escalation: Proceed With Caution\n\nFormal Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs) play more of a defensive than a developmental role in most engineering orgs. Their success rate is bleak\u2014only 16% of developers on PIPs rebound long-term ([Jeli, 2022](https://www.jeli.io/blog/the-engineering-managers-guide-to-performance-improvement-plans)). In reality, they\u2019re more about process and legal clarity than rescuing someone\u2019s career.\n\nIf a PIP is unavoidable:\n- Specify measurable, near-term goals, addressing concrete deliverables.\n- Meet more than just at the milestones\u2014frequent check-ins improve fairness.\n- Keep feedback tied to observable tasks and outcomes.\n\nBut if you reach for a PIP, realize the meaningful turnaround usually happens well before paperwork. The most sustainable improvements come from targeted coaching, paired work, or shifting someone to a role or project where their strengths align. Each failed PIP isn\u2019t just the employee\u2019s loss\u2014it\u2019s rough on you and your credibility, too.\n\nNext, let\u2019s flag the missteps new leads hit most.\n\n## Rookie Traps: What to Avoid as a New Manager\n\nNew managers without history fall into two extremes: waiting so long for more \u201cdata\u201d that momentum stalls, or acting too quickly on rumor and group mood.\n\nWatching patterns:\n\n- Allowing open secrets\u2014where everyone knows about ongoing problems but nothing\u2019s addressed\u2014weakens trust in your leadership.\n- Acting rashly on secondhand complaints risks damaging the reputation of someone who may just need context or a fresh challenge.\n\nBefore you act, check yourself:\n\n- Can you point to actual missed deliverables or documentation?\n- Are expectations for performance clear now and were they before?\n- Does the pattern repeat, or was it a single incident?\n\nIf uncertain, grab a reality check from a peer manager. In the end, don\u2019t delegate responsibility; you own the call.\n\nConsistent, fair intervention is visible to the team and shapes future culture.\n\n## What Good Looks Like\u2014Accountability Meets Empathy\n\nWhen managed well, performance intervention creates transparency, not anxiety. Respected leads keep their bar high and their process transparent: they dig into blockers, ask for direct feedback, and share expectations early.\n\nReal-world stories show this isn\u2019t theory. One engineering manager shared: \u201cAfter pairing our struggling colleague with a peer mentor, and clearly resetting goals week by week, that person rebounded and now leads our most complex feature area\u201d ([Hogan, 2018](https://larahogan.me/blog/low-performers/)). Even if an exit eventually happens, being honest and specific protects the morale of those who remain.\n\nA combination of clarity, curiosity, and consistency transforms these moments from crises into a chance to strengthen\u2014or even reshape\u2014your team.\n\n## Takeaway: Step Up Early, Step Up Fairly\n\nIf you\u2019re the new lead handed an \u201cunderperformer,\u201d don\u2019t reach for the nearest process. Gather real evidence, open a real conversation, and look for the core cause before pushing toward correction or escalation. The hardest moves\u2014early direct talk, honest next steps\u2014are rarely comfortable. But handled well, they\u2019ll define your leadership and make your team stronger in the long run.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n1. Kim Scott, *Radical Candor*, 2017.

  "final_post": "# When Peer Performance Falters: Should Staff+ Engineers Step In, or Leave It to the Manager?\n\n*By [Author Name], [Date]*\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nStaff+ engineers often walk a fine line when a peer\u2019s performance jeopardizes the team: do they intervene directly or pass it off to management? The decision hinges on context and risk, but a practical, thoughtful approach maximizes positive outcomes while minimizing fallout.\n\n- Peer feedback at the Staff+ level is common, yet fraught with social risk.\n- Avoiding difficult conversations leads to real costs in morale and output (Scott, 2017).\n- Not every issue is equal\u2014pattern, persistence, and team impact are crucial filters.\n- Start privately, use specific examples, and seek permission before giving feedback.\n- If the risk or context is unclear, involve managers early.\n- Document interactions if stakes are high; judgment and care matter most.\n\n---\n\nPicture this: You\u2019re a Staff+ engineer and notice that a peer\u2014just as senior as you\u2014keeps dropping critical handoffs, lobbed some pointed remarks in the last two code reviews, and leaves key tickets unclaimed at sprint end. You sense the manager is distracted, and the team\u2019s nerves are starting to fray. Do you step in and have an uncomfortable conversation, risking tension and accusations of overreaching? Or do you keep your head down, hoping it's a temporary glitch, while the team's trust quietly erodes? For senior individual contributors (ICs), the border between leadership and overstep is razor-thin, and the path forward is rarely mapped out.\n\n## The Expanding Role of Staff+ Engineers: Influence Beyond Authority\n\nStaff+ engineers\u2014titles like staff, principal, or distinguished\u2014are trusted to drive technical vision, but they also shape team habits and expectations. Their authority moves sideways, not down. As Will Larson notes, \u201cover 60% of Staff+ engineers routinely navigate situations where peer performance issues demand attention, but without clear mandate\u201d ([Larson, 2021](https://lethain.com/staff-eng/)).\n\nThis position is a double-edged sword. You\u2019re looked to as a steward for team health and results, but you have no formal levers to pull. Overlook problems and decay spreads; jump in clumsily and you risk sowing drama or getting labeled as \u201cthe bossy IC.\u201d The most effective Staff+ engineers understand their impact isn\u2019t just technical but social: they keep the wheels turning, sometimes in ambiguous circumstances.\n\nLet\u2019s look at where that ambiguity turns into action\u2014or misstep.\n\n## Navigating the Boundaries: Authority, Responsibility, and Psychological Safety\n\nAs a Staff+ IC, you may have influence, but you don\u2019t have power. Feedback from a peer is a suggestion\u2014not a directive. So when does stepping in help, and when does it cause harm?\n\nThere is a measurable downside to avoidance: \u201c43% of employees reported leaving a job because of unaddressed feedback issues with a peer or manager\u201d ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/)). Yet, the unofficial reality, traded in backchannel chats and private Slack threads, is that these interventions are risky. Stories abound of conversations gone south\u2014defensive peers, rumors, unwanted escalation to HR, and rifts that linger.\n\nSo the essential question is not just \u201cshould I speak up?\u201d but \u201cwhat happens if no one does?\u201d When a consistent pattern starts to threaten delivery or sap morale, inaction has its own costs.\n\nNavigating these situations is tricky. Public feedback usually backfires, while private approaches require tact. Even then, social safety can be easily punctured\u2014something all too clear when attempts at candid feedback result in drama. The table stakes: Maintain trust, but don\u2019t let silent resignation undermine the very standards that you\u2019re supposed to uphold.\n\nWith stakes this high, deciding whether an issue merits Staff+ intervention becomes a foundational skill.\n\n## When Peer Intervention Matters: Recognizing Impactful Performance Issues\n\nNot every misstep is worth escalating. The pain point is persistent, team-impacting behaviors that quietly hobble collaboration or delivery. Tanya Reilly notes, \u201cStaff+ engineers are often the first to see delivery or behavior issues ripple across teams, but only 1 in 4 organizations formally expect them to act on it\u201d ([Reilly, 2022](https://noidea.dog/path)).\n\nConsider:\n- A peer whose code reviews regularly wait days, blocking launches.\n- Someone who consistently ducks out of on-call rotations, burning out others.\n- Communication patterns that routinely escalate disagreement into gridlock.\n\nTo decide whether to step in, ask:\n- Is this a chronic, visible pattern, not a single lapse?\n- Do the effects spill over to delivery, morale, or team fairness?\n- Is management ignoring it (intentionally or by omission)?\n\nIf you answer \u201cyes\u201d to both pattern and impact, and \u201cno\u201d to credible management engagement, silence becomes an endorsement of the status quo.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided action is warranted, execution matters. Let\u2019s explore how to approach these moments with tact and effect.\n\n## Tactics for Difficult Peer Conversations: Framing, Timing, and Delivery\n\nRaising hard topics with a peer is delicate. Years of experience and supporting research (Stone & Heen, 2014; Scott, 2017) point to a conversational blueprint:\n\n1. **Get clear on your motive.** Is this issue a personal annoyance or a substantive, repeated pattern?\n2. **Anchor in facts, not stories.** Use recent, specific examples:\n    - \u201cLast sprint, your code reviews lingered for days and blocked deployment twice.\u201d\n3. **Start privately and invite feedback.**\n    - \u201cWould you be open to feedback about our current workflow? There\u2019s a trend affecting the team I want to discuss.\u201d\n4. **Frame around shared team goals.**\n    - \u201cTo hit our milestone, we need merges moving quickly. These delays are holding us up.\u201d\n5. **Offer support, not a threat.**\n    - \u201cIs there anything slowing down your reviews? I\u2019m happy to help if possible.\u201d\n6. **If things feel tense, document the interaction.** If you sense possible fallout, make a brief, factual note and consider previewing with a manager.\n\nTeams practicing direct, regular feedback \u201cexperience a 17% improvement in reported psychological safety\u201d ([Scott, 2020](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/radical-candor-at-work-how-to-have-hard-conversations/)). Still, war stories show even a perfect script can misfire\u2014so if you think fallout is likely or the situation is especially sensitive, looping in a manager is not a sign of weakness, but professional caution.\n\nNow, how do you balance independent action with organizational awareness? This is where collaboration with managers is key.\n\n## The Partnership with Managers: Collaborating, Not Undermining\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about context, politics, or personal risk, talk to your manager\u2014up front if possible. The Jellyfish engineering management report found \u201cnearly 78% of engineering leaders say that timely peer feedback is 'critical' or 'very important' to performance management, but less than 40% believe their teams are good at it,\u201d with \u201c55% lacking a formal process at the Staff+ level\u201d ([Jellyfish, 2023](https://jellyfish.co/resources/state-of-engineering-management-report/)). Without a playbook, calibrated partnership matters all the more.\n\nWhat does that look like?\n- \u201cI\u2019ve noticed something affecting our flow, and I\u2019m debating how to address it. Is this on your radar?\u201d\n- \u201cBefore I say anything, is there history or context I might not know?\u201d\n\nSome managers are grateful for early warning and context. Others want to take the first step themselves. Either way, surfacing your intent avoids miscommunication, duplicative feedback, or missing sensitive background.\n\nWith a manager in the loop, feedback is less likely to be interpreted as a power grab, and if things do go sideways, recovering trust and clarity is easier.\n\nLet\u2019s examine what can still go wrong\u2014and how to avoid the most common traps.\n\n## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\nThe bumps are real. Peer interventions fail when surprise, vagueness, or misplaced authority creep in.\n\nAvoid these traps:\n- **Springing feedback unannounced.** Even in private, abrupt feedback triggers defensiveness.\n- **Involving others prematurely.** Gossip or indirect escalation erodes team trust.\n- **Sounding managerial.** Jargon about \u201cexpectations\u201d or \u201cconsequences\u201d signals overstepping.\n\nSharpen your approach by:\n- Initiating a direct, private, specific conversation.\n- Focusing on observed behaviors and their effects, not intent or character.\n- Looping in a manager *before* things escalate, not as a last resort.\n\nThe best Staff+ engineers develop a nose for risk\u2014and when in doubt, they slow down and check with trusted allies before acting.\n\n## Summary: A Principles-Based Approach for Staff+ Influence\n\nStaff+ engineers don\u2019t just shape systems and code. Their influence is felt in the hard, quiet moments\u2014when a peer\u2019s behavior could hurt the whole team. Sometimes, stepping up is the only way to prevent mediocrity or attrition: \u201c43% of employees\u201d have left jobs over unaddressed feedback conflicts ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/)). But a rushed or clumsy intervention can wound trust and reputation that\u2019s taken years to build.\n\nThe task is judgment: Get clear on stakes and impact, stay specific and transparent, avoid lone-wolf heroics, and don\u2019t fear partnership with managers. Staff+ influence lies as much in knowing *when* to act as in knowing *how*. Navigated with care, these conversations can safeguard both delivery and culture in ways that echo long after the project ships.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n1. **Will Larson, Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track, 2021**  \n   [https://lethain.com/staff-eng/](https://lethain.com/staff-eng/)  \n   Framework for Staff+ ambiguity and relevant stats on performance dilemmas.\n\n2. **Kim Scott, Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity, 2017, and Radical Candor Blog, 2020**  \n   [https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/)  \n   Stats, framework, and best practices for direct feedback.\n\n3. **Tanya Reilly, The Staff Engineer\u2019s Path: Navigating Peer Accountability, 2022**  \n   [https://noidea.dog/path](https://noidea.dog/path)  \n   Perspective and examples on peer performance and ambiguity.\n\n4. **Jellyfish, 2023 State of Engineering Management Report, 2023**  \n   [https://jellyfish.co/resources/state-of-engineering-management-report/](https://jellyfish.co/resources/state-of-engineering-management-report/)  \n   Survey data on peer feedback prevalence and gaps.\n\n5. **Douglas Stone & Sheila Heen, Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well, 2014**  \n   [Summary: https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00339](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00339)  \n   Tactics and data on feedback discomfort among peers."

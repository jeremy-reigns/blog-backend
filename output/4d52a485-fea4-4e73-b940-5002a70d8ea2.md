# How to Handle Difficult Conversations as an Engineering Manager — Especially When Performance Management Scares You

_By [Author Name], [Date]_

**TL;DR:**  
Performance conversations as a new engineering manager—especially with a team you hardly know—can feel overwhelming. You can navigate them with clarity and credibility by being concrete, transparent, and genuinely human, even when the data or trust is limited.

- Focus your energy on repeated or high-stakes issues, not everyday awkward feedback.
- Gather recent, direct evidence; skip the hearsay and fuzzy impressions.
- Structure discussions for clarity: open honestly, cite specifics, ask for context, and plan next steps together.
- Name your own nerves—acknowledging tension lowers it for both sides.
- Don’t over-soften, over-document, or punt difficult talks into the future.
- Success is about shared understanding—not immediate harmony.

You barely know your direct reports, but you’re already facing your first performance issue as an engineering manager. There’s a knot in your stomach as you realize the feedback you’ve collected is patchy, and your understanding of team history is wafer-thin. The playbooks make it sound like process and empathy will fix everything, but the reality is trickier: you’re balancing the risk of upending fragile trust against letting real problems drag on. How do you step into this conversation without making things worse—for them, for the team, or for yourself?

## Why Difficult Conversations Trigger Anxiety in New Engineering Managers

You’re not alone in your nerves. In a 2023 survey, 43% of managers admitted they feel anxious before giving negative feedback, and more than one in five managers said they delay or avoid these conversations altogether (15Five, 2023, [link](https://www.15five.com/resources/research/state-of-employee-experience-2023)). For new engineering managers, the stress doubles: you haven’t built deep relationships, you lack long-term data, and you may not have the technical context to know “how things have always been done.” When your power as a manager collides with your uncertainty as a newcomer, it’s easy to second-guess every word.

Beyond your own discomfort, there’s also team suspicion—no one likes receiving performance feedback from someone who barely knows them. Mishandled conversations can backfire, souring morale or accelerating attrition. Accept that the discomfort is real—a common struggle, not a flaw. That perspective frees you to tackle the hard work, not just the scripted version.

Next, it’s critical to distinguish which issues truly require a “difficult conversation” versus normal, everyday course corrections.

## Not Every Feedback Moment Needs the “Hard Talk” Treatment

It’s a mistake to treat every awkward or corrective conversation as a career-level event. A small bug in a pull request or a curt comment in chat needs a lighter touch than a pattern of missed deadlines or eroding trust.

Ask yourself:

- Has the issue happened more than once or twice?
- Is this impacting others or derailing work beyond the individual?
- Will inaction let the problem fester and grow?

If so, prepare more deeply—it’s genuinely a high-stakes conversation. If not, resist over-indexing on drama. Many new managers burn out by treating every tough moment like an HR formal. Save your energy—and theirs—for the situations that shape the team’s direction.

This mindset also helps reduce anxiety by reserving your “all-in” attention for times when protecting the team or the long-term culture is actually needed.

## Gathering Evidence When You Don’t Have History

One of the trickiest challenges for a new manager: you don’t have years of personal observation or context to lean on. Secondhand accounts and half-remembered backstories are risky—you don’t want to inherit old grudges or act on rumor. What’s left is simple but powerful: focus on the recent, observable, and objective.

Before meeting, try:

- Reviewing the last couple of sprints for patterns in missed commitments, incomplete JIRA tickets, or repeated build failures.
- Checking PRs for recurring review issues or rework that creates friction downstream.
- Collecting any peer feedback that references specific incidents—not general opinions.

Gut-check your material with a simple test: “Could I walk through these points with another manager and be confident I have my facts straight?” If not, dig further.

Research supports this approach: managers who ground hard conversations in specific, up-to-date observations dramatically reduce misunderstandings and repeated conflicts (Patterson et al., 2011, _Crucial Conversations_). And if you’re coming in cold, say so. “I recognize I don’t have historical context, but here’s what I’ve seen since joining…” Honesty about your own limitations fosters trust and keeps the conversation from feeling like a trial.

Strong prep also builds your own confidence. Even a modest review of data or artifacts, done with integrity, helps you lead the discussion rather than get bowled over by new information or defensiveness (LeadDev Editorial, 2021, [link](https://leaddev.com/people/framework-challenging-conversations-engineers)).

Once you have a foundation, move toward the conversation itself: not by script, but through intent and structure.

## Running the Conversation—Practical Structures That Work

Rigid scripts rarely hold up in the real world, but a flexible framework is invaluable. One popular model—Radical Candor—urges managers to “care personally and challenge directly” (Scott, 2017). Here’s a practical flow that respects both intent and flexibility:

1. **Open honestly:**  
   “I want to check in about something that’s come up in my short time here.”

2. **State what you’ve observed:**  
   “I noticed that in the last two sprints, you’ve missed key deadlines—like the payment integration PR, which took several rounds of rework.”

3. **Solicit their perspective:**  
   “Can you share what’s been going on from your end? I know I may be missing context.”

4. **Discuss impact and options:**  
   “These misses are starting to affect the team’s overall progress. I’d like to figure out what needs to change—how can I help make that practical?”

5. **Confirm shared understanding and plan:**  
   “Let’s touch base after the next sprint to see what’s working better, and please keep giving me feedback too.”

These steps keep you grounded in facts, invite honesty, and focus on outcomes rather than blame or venting. Key: mention openly where your own knowledge is limited. This doesn’t undermine your authority; it builds mutual trust and protects against blind spots.

It’s also worth naming emotions in the room. Veteran managers report that a simple admission—“I’m a bit nervous too, but I want to make this as helpful as possible”—makes the conversation less adversarial (Julie Zhuo, 2019, [link](https://www.juliezhou.com/writing/giving-difficult-feedback)).

Now, with structure and awareness, it’s time to address the nerves that haunt even the best prep.

## Navigating Your Own Anxiety—Before, During, and After

Even practiced managers admit sweaty palms and tight throats before performance conversations (15Five, 2023). For new managers, that pressure can be paralyzing. Here’s what works:

Beforehand, recite your opening and evidence out loud. This isn’t theater—verbal rehearsal knocks off nerves and prevents opening fumbles. Take just enough notes to stay organized, but avoid scripting every interaction. When the moment arrives, let the conversation breathe. If it gets tense, narrate it gently: “I know this conversation feels awkward. That’s normal, and it means we care about getting it right.”

Afterward, give yourself space to debrief, jot a short log for your own learning (and, yes, for compliance), and move on. Don’t let one rocky talk sour your view of your role or your report—reflection, not rumination, is how you’ll improve this skill over time.

These habits are not “soft skills”—they’re the foundation for resilience and long-term credibility as a manager.

With emotions and structure managed, beware the mistakes that trip up even diligent leaders.

## Pitfalls: Where Good Intentions Go Sideways

Some errors cut across experience levels. The top avoidable traps:

- **Over-softening:** If you dilute the message, you risk no improvement. “You’re doing mostly fine, just…” isn’t feedback—it's confusion.
- **Defaulting to heavy documentation:** New managers sometimes log everything “just in case,” making reports feel they’re already under HR’s microscope. Document, but don’t let it replace conversation.
- **Letting discomfort stall you:** The longer you wait, the harder the conversation becomes, and the more baked-in the problem gets.
- **Relying on data alone:** Metrics matter, but teams look for context and fairness—numbers can’t explain away surprise blockers or team dynamics.

Even if you trip up, revisiting the conversation and owning your mistakes is almost always repairable. Openness and humility are remembered longer than perfect delivery.

Next, let’s talk about realistic metrics of success.

## What “Good” Looks Like (And What “Success” Isn’t)

A successful difficult conversation is rarely glamorous or cathartic. Often, it’s quiet: you’ve made the issue clear, you have a plan, and neither side is retreating or defensive. Sometimes, the best outcome is agreement to track changes and review soon. Other times, you learn there’s a hidden blocker—a personal issue, a process gap, or something outside your initial view—that only the conversation surfaced.

Research—and community consensus—shows that regular, direct feedback (not just praise or scripted critique) is closely tied to both team engagement and retention (Scott, 2017; 15Five, 2023). Don’t chase instant agreement or a tension-free room. If you’ve set a direction and established commitment to improvement, that’s a win. Over the long run, the ability to handle messiness head-on is what moves both manager and team forward.

## Final Thoughts

Performance management as a green engineering manager can feel like walking a tightrope with no net. Yet by holding yourself to specifics, showing honest vulnerability about what you do and don’t know, and focusing on clarity over comfort, you build resilience and trust with your team. These talks will never be easy—but with preparation and openness, they can become productive, sometimes even transformative, for everyone involved.

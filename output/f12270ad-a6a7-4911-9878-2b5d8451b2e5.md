# When Peer Performance Falters: Should Staff+ Engineers Step In, or Leave It to the Manager?

*By [Author Name], [Date]*

## TL;DR

Staff+ engineers often walk a fine line when a peer’s performance jeopardizes the team: do they intervene directly or pass it off to management? The decision hinges on context and risk, but a practical, thoughtful approach maximizes positive outcomes while minimizing fallout.

- Peer feedback at the Staff+ level is common, yet fraught with social risk.
- Avoiding difficult conversations leads to real costs in morale and output (Scott, 2017).
- Not every issue is equal—pattern, persistence, and team impact are crucial filters.
- Start privately, use specific examples, and seek permission before giving feedback.
- If the risk or context is unclear, involve managers early.
- Document interactions if stakes are high; judgment and care matter most.

Picture this: You’re a Staff+ engineer and notice that a peer—just as senior as you—keeps dropping critical handoffs, lobbed some pointed remarks in the last two code reviews, and leaves key tickets unclaimed at sprint end. You sense the manager is distracted, and the team’s nerves are starting to fray. Do you step in and have an uncomfortable conversation, risking tension and accusations of overreaching? Or do you keep your head down, hoping it's a temporary glitch, while the team's trust quietly erodes? For senior individual contributors (ICs), the border between leadership and overstep is razor-thin, and the path forward is rarely mapped out.

## The Expanding Role of Staff+ Engineers: Influence Beyond Authority

Staff+ engineers—titles like staff, principal, or distinguished—are trusted to drive technical vision, but they also shape team habits and expectations. Their authority moves sideways, not down. As Will Larson notes, “over 60% of Staff+ engineers routinely navigate situations where peer performance issues demand attention, but without clear mandate” ([Larson, 2021](https://lethain.com/staff-eng/)).

This position is a double-edged sword. You’re looked to as a steward for team health and results, but you have no formal levers to pull. Overlook problems and decay spreads; jump in clumsily and you risk sowing drama or getting labeled as “the bossy IC.” The most effective Staff+ engineers understand their impact isn’t just technical but social: they keep the wheels turning, sometimes in ambiguous circumstances.

Let’s look at where that ambiguity turns into action—or misstep.

## Navigating the Boundaries: Authority, Responsibility, and Psychological Safety

As a Staff+ IC, you may have influence, but you don’t have power. Feedback from a peer is a suggestion—not a directive. So when does stepping in help, and when does it cause harm?

There is a measurable downside to avoidance: “43% of employees reported leaving a job because of unaddressed feedback issues with a peer or manager” ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/)). Yet, the unofficial reality, traded in backchannel chats and private Slack threads, is that these interventions are risky. Stories abound of conversations gone south—defensive peers, rumors, unwanted escalation to HR, and rifts that linger.

So the essential question is not just “should I speak up?” but “what happens if no one does?” When a consistent pattern starts to threaten delivery or sap morale, inaction has its own costs.

Navigating these situations is tricky. Public feedback usually backfires, while private approaches require tact. Even then, social safety can be easily punctured—something all too clear when attempts at candid feedback result in drama. The table stakes: Maintain trust, but don’t let silent resignation undermine the very standards that you’re supposed to uphold.

With stakes this high, deciding whether an issue merits Staff+ intervention becomes a foundational skill.

## When Peer Intervention Matters: Recognizing Impactful Performance Issues

Not every misstep is worth escalating. The pain point is persistent, team-impacting behaviors that quietly hobble collaboration or delivery. Tanya Reilly notes, “Staff+ engineers are often the first to see delivery or behavior issues ripple across teams, but only 1 in 4 organizations formally expect them to act on it” ([Reilly, 2022](https://noidea.dog/path)).

Consider:
- A peer whose code reviews regularly wait days, blocking launches.
- Someone who consistently ducks out of on-call rotations, burning out others.
- Communication patterns that routinely escalate disagreement into gridlock.

To decide whether to step in, ask:
- Is this a chronic, visible pattern, not a single lapse?
- Do the effects spill over to delivery, morale, or team fairness?
- Is management ignoring it (intentionally or by omission)?

If you answer “yes” to both pattern and impact, and “no” to credible management engagement, silence becomes an endorsement of the status quo.

Once you’ve decided action is warranted, execution matters. Let’s explore how to approach these moments with tact and effect.

## Tactics for Difficult Peer Conversations: Framing, Timing, and Delivery

Raising hard topics with a peer is delicate. Years of experience and supporting research (Stone & Heen, 2014; Scott, 2017) point to a conversational blueprint:

1. **Get clear on your motive.** Is this issue a personal annoyance or a substantive, repeated pattern?
2. **Anchor in facts, not stories.** Use recent, specific examples:
    - “Last sprint, your code reviews lingered for days and blocked deployment twice.”
3. **Start privately and invite feedback.**
    - “Would you be open to feedback about our current workflow? There’s a trend affecting the team I want to discuss.”
4. **Frame around shared team goals.**
    - “To hit our milestone, we need merges moving quickly. These delays are holding us up.”
5. **Offer support, not a threat.**
    - “Is there anything slowing down your reviews? I’m happy to help if possible.”
6. **If things feel tense, document the interaction.** If you sense possible fallout, make a brief, factual note and consider previewing with a manager.

Teams practicing direct, regular feedback “experience a 17% improvement in reported psychological safety” ([Scott, 2020](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/radical-candor-at-work-how-to-have-hard-conversations/)). Still, war stories show even a perfect script can misfire—so if you think fallout is likely or the situation is especially sensitive, looping in a manager is not a sign of weakness, but professional caution.

Now, how do you balance independent action with organizational awareness? This is where collaboration with managers is key.

## The Partnership with Managers: Collaborating, Not Undermining

If you’re worried about context, politics, or personal risk, talk to your manager—up front if possible. The Jellyfish engineering management report found “nearly 78% of engineering leaders say that timely peer feedback is 'critical' or 'very important' to performance management, but less than 40% believe their teams are good at it,” with “55% lacking a formal process at the Staff+ level” ([Jellyfish, 2023](https://jellyfish.co/resources/state-of-engineering-management-report/)). Without a playbook, calibrated partnership matters all the more.

What does that look like?
- “I’ve noticed something affecting our flow, and I’m debating how to address it. Is this on your radar?”
- “Before I say anything, is there history or context I might not know?”

Some managers are grateful for early warning and context. Others want to take the first step themselves. Either way, surfacing your intent avoids miscommunication, duplicative feedback, or missing sensitive background.

With a manager in the loop, feedback is less likely to be interpreted as a power grab, and if things do go sideways, recovering trust and clarity is easier.

Let’s examine what can still go wrong—and how to avoid the most common traps.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

The bumps are real. Peer interventions fail when surprise, vagueness, or misplaced authority creep in.

Avoid these traps:
- **Springing feedback unannounced.** Even in private, abrupt feedback triggers defensiveness.
- **Involving others prematurely.** Gossip or indirect escalation erodes team trust.
- **Sounding managerial.** Jargon about “expectations” or “consequences” signals overstepping.

Sharpen your approach by:
- Initiating a direct, private, specific conversation.
- Focusing on observed behaviors and their effects, not intent or character.
- Looping in a manager *before* things escalate, not as a last resort.

The best Staff+ engineers develop a nose for risk—and when in doubt, they slow down and check with trusted allies before acting.

## Summary: A Principles-Based Approach for Staff+ Influence

Staff+ engineers don’t just shape systems and code. Their influence is felt in the hard, quiet moments—when a peer’s behavior could hurt the whole team. Sometimes, stepping up is the only way to prevent mediocrity or attrition: “43% of employees” have left jobs over unaddressed feedback conflicts ([Scott, 2017](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/how-to-give-feedback-at-work/)). But a rushed or clumsy intervention can wound trust and reputation that’s taken years to build.

The task is judgment: Get clear on stakes and impact, stay specific and transparent, avoid lone-wolf heroics, and don’t fear partnership with managers. Staff+ influence lies as much in knowing *when* to act as in knowing *how*. Navigated with care, these conversations can safeguard both delivery and culture in ways that echo long after the project ships.
